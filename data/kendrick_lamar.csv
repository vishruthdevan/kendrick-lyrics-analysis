Fuck Your Ethnicity,Section.80,,1,3:44,Colin Munroe,Studio,1,2 Jul 11,16,"Gather 'round
 I'm glad everybody came out tonight
 As we stand on our neighborhood corner
 Know that this fire that's burning represents the passion you have
 Listen
 Keisha, Tammy, come up front
 I recognize all of you
 Every creed and color
 With that being said
 Fuck your ethnicity
 You understand that?
 We gon' talk about a lot of shit that concerns you, all of you
 Now everybody, throw your hands up high
 If you don't give a fuck, throw your hands up high
 Throw your hands up high
 Now, I don't give a fuck if you
 Black, white, Asian, Hispanic, goddammit
 That don't mean shit to me
 Fuck your ethnicity, nigga
 Fire burning inside my eyes, this the music that saved my life
 Y'all be calling it hip-hop, I be calling it hypnotize
 Yeah, hypnotize, trapped my body, but freed my mind
 What the fuck are you fighting for? Ain't nobody gon' win that war
 My details be retail, man, I got so much in store
 Racism is still alive, yellow tape and colored lines
 Fuck that, nigga, look at that line, it's so diverse
 They gettin' off work and they wanna see Kendrick
 Everybody can't drive Benzes, and I been there, so I make it my business
 To give 'em my full attention, ten-hut, man, I gotta get my wind up
 Man, I gotta get down with God 'cause I got my sins up, ooh
 Matter fact, don't mistake me for no fuckin' rapper
 They sit backstage and hide behind them fuckin' cameras
 I mosh pit, had a microphone and I tossed it
 Had a brain, then I lost it
 I'm out of my mind, so don't you mind how much the cost is
 Penny for my thoughts, everybody, please hold up your wallets
 Yeah, man, I'm the mailman, can't you tell, man?
 Gone postal, never freeze up when I approach you
 That's starstruck and roast you, oh my
 HiiiPoWeR
 Reporting live from Planet Terminator X
 I saw Martin Luther King with an AK-47
 Now, I don't give a fuck if you
 Black, white, Asian, Hispanic, goddammit
 That don't mean shit to me
 Fuck your ethnicity, nigga
 I'm tired of y'all, 'cause everybody lied to y'all
 And you believe it? Recognize them false achievements
 It's treason and I'm Tylenol, I knock out when you knock it off
 Knock on the doors of opportunity, I'm too involved
 I'm no activist, I'm no Einstein
 Before calculus, I was kicking that math
 Dropping that science like an alchemist and I be kicking that ass
 Lyrically, I'm UFC
 If a UFO had came for me, I'ma come back with the head of an alien
 Don't alienate my dreams
 Get it right, get a life, I got two
 That's a metaphor for the big shit I do
 Boy, TMI, TSA, man, I'm fly
 Put wings on my back
 That a plane or an angel? Both
 Like a pilot with a halo, woah
 Gross
 I mean, I've seen so many things come through them, him, her, you, mmm, mmm, mmm, mmm
 I'm just a messenger
 Yeah, I know life's a bitch, get the best of her
 Put them threes up, they notice that we up
 HiiiPoWeR and the power in the people and if they don't believe us
 They'll die
 Wizard
 Now, I don't give a fuck if you
 Black, white, Asian, Hispanic, goddammit
 That don't mean shit to me

Hol' Up,Section.80,,2,2:53,,Studio,1,2 Jul 11,16,"I wrote this record while thirty thousand feet in the air
 Stewardess complimenting me on my nappy hair
 If I can fuck her in front of all of these passengers
 They'll probably think I'm a terrorist, eat my asparagus
 Then I'm asking her thoughts of a young nigga
 Fast money and freedom, a crash dummy for dollars
 I know you dying to meet him, I'll probably die in a minute
 Just bury me with twenty bitches, twenty million, and a Comptown fitted
 Hol' up (Hol' up), hol' up (Hol' up)
 Hol' up (Hol' up), hol' up (Hol' up)
 Yeah, big shit poppin'
 Section.80
 Back in this bitch, in the back of that bitch
 With my back against the wall and your bitch on the edge of my dick, jump off
 I call a bitch a bitch, a ho a ho, a woman a woman
 I never did nothing but break the ground on top of the asphalt
 Tire mark gave you evidence that I'm easily peddlin'
 With the speed of a lightning bolt
 As a kid, I killed two adults, I'm too advanced
 I lived my twenties at two years old, the wiser man
 Truth be told, I'm like eighty-seven
 Wicked as eighty reverends in a pool of fire with devils holding hands
 From a distance, don't know which one is a Christian, damn
 Who can I trust in 2012? there's no one, not even myself
 A Gemini screaming for help, somebody
 Hol' up (Hol' up), hol' up (Hol' up)
 Hol' up (Hol' up), hol' up (Hol' up)

 Yeah, big shit poppin'
 Ayy, ayy, kick her out the studio, Ali
 24/7, nigga working his ass for it, she poppin' that ass for
 The King of Diamonds with diamonds, I never do ask for it
 They checkin' my passport, I'm too accustomed with customs
 You callin' the task force, I killed it, somebody cuff him
 They want me to fast forward the game, and
 Why you complain when you niggas is past poor?
 You'll never hop in my lane when you pushing a RAV4
 You wrecking my Jaguar
 You play like a bad sport
 Her feet on the dashboard

 Two pills and a half-weight, nigga, fuck that

 Man, I swear my nigga trippin' off that shit again
 Pick him up, then I set him in cold water
 Then I order someone to bring him Vicodin
 Hope that take the pain away
 From the feelin' that he feel today
 You know when you part of Section.80
 You feel like no one can relate
 'Cause you are, you are, a loner, loner
 Marijuana endorphins make you stronger, stronger
 I'm in the house party trippin' off
 My generation sippin' cough syrup like it's water
 Never no pancakes in the kitchen
 Man, not one of our lives is caught up
 In the daily superstition that the world is 'bout to end
 Who gives a fuck? We never do listen
 'Less it comes with an 808 (A melody and some hoes)
 PlayStation and some drank (Technology bought my soul)

 And they probably relatives relevant for a rebel's dream

 And then she started feelin' herself like no one else in this apartment
 ""Beg your pardon? Oh, I rap, baby, how old are you?""
 She say twenty-two, I say twenty-three, ""Okay, then we are crack babies,"" damn
 ""Why you say that?"" She said, ""Where my drink at?""
 ""I'ma tell you later, just tell your neighbors and the police relax""
 I stood up, shut the blind, closed the screen, Jumbotron
 Made to the back where she reside, then she said, ""Read between the lines,"" yep
 Hope that I get close enough when the lights turn down
 And the fact that she just might open up when the Nuvo start to drown
 Her body, and I know the both of us really deep in the mood now
 It's nothin' we can do now, somebody walked in with a pound (Woah)
 Of that Bay Area kush, she looked at me, then looked
 At it, then she grabbed it, then she said, ""Get it understood""
 ""You know why we crack babies? Because we born in the '80s
 The A.D.H.D. crazy""

No Make-Up (Her Vice),Section.80,,4,3:55,,Studio,1,2 Jul 11,16,"I love the way you put it on your eyes

 No make-up today, no make-up today, today
 No make-up today, no make-up today
 And girl, that's fine, but I wanna know, do you mind?
 I know she 'bout to ask me how she look
 I tell her beautiful and how long it took
 For you to put it on, it was early in the morn'
 She resembled a model out of a MAC book
 Concentrating on the way the eyeliner thickens
 I stand behind her and try to figure her vision
 Of prettiness, the wittiness of colors on her skin tone
 Her complexion in a direction I've outgrown
 Damn girl, why so much?
 You 'bout to blow your cover when you cover up
 Don't you know your imperfections is a wonderful blessing?
 From Heaven is where you got it from
 I love your smile, you can do it without style
 From your lips all the way to your eyebrows
 It's the beauty in her, but when the make-up occur
 I don't see it, all I see is a blur
 I love the way you put it on your eyes
 The roses on your face light up the sky

 I can never put on too much make-up
 Yeah, I know your imperfections, I be constantly stressing
 From him is where I get it from, they tell me I need to
 Smile at least once in a while
 I hate my lips, my nose, my eyebrows
 It's the beauty in me, but what he don't see
 Is that I had a black eye— to be continued, eleven

 I know this girl, she a real good girl and she be low-key
 Looking like a star with a real nice car, a Mercedes key
 And she got a nigga and she love this nigga, well, at least I think
 Every time we bark, she pay us no mind in the middle of the street
 She be like
 Fuck them other niggas 'cause I'm down for my nigga
 Fuck them other niggas 'cause I'm down for my nigga
 Fuck them other niggas, I'll ride for my nigga
 I'll die for my nigga, fuck them other—
 Until one day, he wasn't acting right
 In the middle of the night, she checked his phone, Erica, right?
 When he pled the Fifth, man, it was on, matter fact, she gone
 Matter fact, Tyrone was on speed dial, so when she got home
 It was going down, she go
 Fuck that other nigga when she tired of her nigga
 Fuck that other nigga when she tired of her nigga
 Fuck that other nigga when she tired of her nigga
 Sick of lies from her nigga, fuck that other—
 I know this girl, she a real hood girl, and she with the shit
 Keep her hair tied up, big bamboos, Mike Jordan kicks
 With that big butt, but when I try to holla, she gon' resist
 In her man, she trust, so when I walk by her, she be screaming this
 She be like
 Fuck them other niggas 'cause I'm down for my nigga
 Fuck them other niggas 'cause I'm down for my nigga
 Fuck them other niggas, I'll ride for my nigga
 I'll die for my nigga, fuck them other—
 Until one day, he wasn't acting right
 In the middle of the night, she checked his pockets, found condoms by
 Magnum, and the moment they was acknowledged, she popped his eye
 Then ran outside, then started drivin' on the passenger side
 Homeboy was smiling, she gon'
 Fuck that other nigga when she tired of her nigga
 Fuck that other nigga when she tired of her nigga
 Fuck that other nigga when she tired of her nigga
 Sick of lies from her nigga, fuck that other—
 And so these girls, these vulnerable girls
 Took they men up, put 'em in they world, they vulnerable world
 And just like that, it was only gettin', got they feelings hurt
 Tell me how that sound? They got fed up with the biggest question mark
 They curious now
 'Cause when women get sick of men, they think of a big helping hand
 To lend each other, uncover emotions when lights dim
 So when she telling her to come over, it'll be alright
 The minute she hit the block and turn left, she'll be turning dyke, they go
 Fuck with other bitches when they tired of these niggas
 Fuck with other bitches when they tired of these niggas
 Fuck with other bitches on the side 'cause these niggas—

 'Cause the kids just ain't alright
 Oh shit, nigga
 Somethin' 'bout to happen
 Nigga, this shit, nigga, this sound like thirty keys under the Compton court building
 Hope the dogs don't smell it
 Welcome to vigilante, '80s, so don't you ask me
 I'm hungry, my body's antsy, I rip through your fuckin' pantry
 Peelin' off like a Xanny, examine my orchestra
 Granny said when I'm old enough, I'll be sure to be all I can be
 You niggas Marcus Camby, washed up
 Pussy, fix your panties, I'm Mr. Marcus, you gettin' fucked, uh
 You ain't heard nothin' harder since Daddy Kane
 Take it in vain, Vicodins couldn't ease the pain
 Lightning bolts hit your body, you thought it rained
 Not a cloud in sight, just the shit that I write
 Strong enough to stand in front of a travelin' freight train, are you trained?
 To go against Dracula, draggin' the record industry by my fangs
 AK clips, money clips, and gold chains
 You walk around with a P90 like it's the '90s
 Bullet to your temple, your homicide'll remind me
 That Compton Crip niggas ain't nothin' to fuck with
 Bompton Pirus ain't nothin' to fuck with
 Compton éses ain't nothin' to fuck with
 But they fuck with me, and bitch, I love it
 Woop-di-woop, woop-di-woop-woop, woop-di-woop

 Woop-di-woop, woop-di-woop-woop, woop-di-woop
 Woop-di-woop, woop-di-woop-woop (California Dungeons)
 Let's hit the county buildin', gotta cash my check
 Spend it all on a forty-ounce to the neck
 And in retrospect, I remember December being the hottest
 Squad cars, neighborhood wars, and stolen Mazdas
 I tell you motherfuckers that life is full of hydraulics
 Up and down, get a six-four, better know how to drive it
 I'm drivin' on E with no license or registration
 Heart racin', racin' past Johnny because he's racist
 1987, the children of Ronald Reagan
 Rake the leaves off your front porch with a machine blowtorch (I'm really out here, my nigga)
 He blowin' on stress, hopin' to ease the stress (Like, really out here)
 He coppin' some blow, hopin' that it can stretch
 Newborn massacre
 Hoppin' out the passenger with calendars 'cause your day comin'
 Run him down and then he gun him down, I'm hopin' that you fast enough
 Even the legs of Michael Johnson don't mean nothin', because
 Compton Crip niggas ain't nothin' to fuck with
 Bompton Pirus ain't nothin' to fuck with
 Compton éses ain't nothin' to fuck with
 But they fuck with me, and bitch, I love it
 Woop-di-woop, woop-di-woop-woop, woop-di-woop
 Woop-di-woop, woop-di-woop-woop (California Dungeons)

 Can't detour when you at war with your city, why run for it?

 Smoke good, eat good, live good
 Smoke good, eat good, live good
 Smoke good, eat good, live good
 I used to want to see the penitentiary way after elementary
 Thought it was cool to look the judge in the face when he sentenced me
 Since my uncles was institutionalized
 My intuition had said I was suited for family ties
 My mama is stressin', my daddy tired
 I need me a weapon, these niggas ride
 Every minute, hour, and second, ministers tried to save me
 How I'm gon' listen when I don't even hear God?
 Heaven or hell, base it all on my instincts
 My hands dirty, you worried 'bout mud in your sink
 You like to mistake a street nigga for real nigga
 The same nigga that kill with you'll squeal with you
 I deal with you like my son, stare at the sun
 And you'll be looking in my eyes, homie
 Stand for something or fall for anything
 And you working with two left feet at the skating rink
 But anyway, this for my niggas
 Uncles, twenty-three hours, sendin' me pictures
 I want you to know that I'm so determined to blow
 That you hear the music I wrote, hope it get you off death row
 You came home to a pocket full of stones
 A Metro PC phone, then you went back in
 So when I touch the pen, the pen is in my view
 I'ma get it right, just so you
 Smoke good, eat good, live good
 Smoke good, eat good, live good
 Smoke good, eat good, live good
 Smoke good, eat good, live good
 Smoke good, eat good, live good
 And I do this for the city
 Got some Hennessy and my real niggas with me
 Fuck the police, they gon' have to come and get me
 If it feel good to you, holler if you hear me
 You like to mistake a street nigga for real nigga
 The same nigga that kill with you'll squeal with you
 I like to start it out from the bottom and build with you
 Be on my last dollar and split the bill with you
 I'm twenty-three with morals and plans of living cordial
 Not rich, but wealthy, there's nothing you can tell me
 My killings are not remorseful
 The city got my back, and for that, I give them my torso
 You think about it and don't call me lyrical
 'Cause really I'm just a nigga that's evil and spiritual
 I know some rappers using big words to make they similes curve
 My simplest shit be more pivotal
 I penetrate the hearts of good kids and criminals
 Worrisome individuals that live life critical
 So won't you bear witness while I bare feet?
 So you can walk in my shoes and get to know me
 But anyway, this for my pops
 On his lunch break eating in that parking lot
 On ""Wanna Be Heard,"" probably thought he worked my nerves
 But really he was stressing me gettin' what I deserve
 Somebody said my name on the radio
 He ain't know I was ready for the world that minute
 So the next time he roll up and drop grams in it
 He probably be out of work, laid back, while he
 Smoke good, eat good, live good
 Smoke good, eat good, live good
 Smoke good, eat good, live good
 Smoke good, eat good, live good

 And I do this for the city

 Fuck the police, they gon' have to come and get me
 If it feel good to you, holler if you hear me
 Church is definitely on the move and now we done took it up to the cathedral
 'Cause the ism is enormous, you know what I'm talking 'bout?
 We out here rotating under the five P's
 Proper preparation prevents poor performance, you know what I'm talking 'bout?
 Doing my thing 'cause I'm rotating with my speakers thumping
 From the Windy City streets all the way out here to the streets of Compton
 Know what I'm talking 'bout?
 Church is definitely on the move and we gon' continue to hustle and grow and develop by far
 As I rotate with my true player partner by the name of Kendrick Lamar, you know what I'm talking 'bout?
 This is the ism, this is the vision, you know what I'm talking 'bout?
 Gotta get up off your ass and get it, man
 That's the only way your pockets gon' expand
 I tell you everyday, you know what I'm talking 'bout?
 Apply yourself to supply your wealth
 Only limitations you'll ever have are those that you place upon yourself
 Church is definitely on the move, you know what I'm talking 'bout?
 Exercise your ism, and don't depend on no one else

 When I was sleeping on couches
 Nigga couldn't get a call, just a Glock for my vouch
 Nigga I was mothafuckin' out, yeah
 With the flashing lights had me stuck like reindeer
 When I should have been making bank, yeah
 I was somewhere stuck where the flame is
 Mothafucka, see how far that I came here
 Went broke and I came up in the same year, can I get a hell yeah?
 Drop my tear, hold my joy, show my pride
 Music saved my fucking life, I'm doing right and you left behind

Keisha's Song (Her Pain),Section.80,,11,3:47,Ashtrobot,Studio,1,2 Jul 11,16,"Fancy girls on Long Beach Boulevard
 Flagging down all of these flashy cars
 Uh, and Lord knows she's beautiful
 Lord knows the usuals leaving her body sore
 She take the little change she make to fix her nail cuticles
 Lipstick is suitable to make you fiend for more
 She play Mr. Shakur, that's her favorite rapper
 Bumpin' ""Brenda's Got a Baby"" while a pervert yellin' at her
 And she capture features of a woman, but only seventeen
 Then seven cars start honking
 She start running like Flo-Jo, don't care if they Joe Blow
 If they got money to blow, a blow job is a sure go
 And sure enough, don't see a dime of dirty dollars
 Just give it all to her daddy, but she don't know her father
 That's ironic
 See, a block away from Lueders Park, I seen an El Camino parked
 And in her heart, she hate it there, but in her mind, she made it where
 Nothin' really matters, so she hit the back seat
 Rosa Parks never a factor when she makin' ends meet
 Fancy girls on Long Beach Boulevard
 Flagging down all of these flashy cars
 And Lord knows she's beautiful
 Lord knows the usuals leaving her body sore
 Her anatomy is God's temple
 And it's quite simple, her castle is 'bout to be destroyed
 She's always paranoid, watching the law inside the streets
 Undercovers, the dummies that look like decoys
 Remember sergeant let her slide
 Said if he seen what's between her thighs, he'd compromise
 To no surprise
 She took the ultimatum 'round the alleyway and gave him
 A warm welcome, then felt him right below the navel
 Though he was wired up like a pair of jumping cables
 His eyes was closed shut, prior charges, he had waived 'em
 It was a block away from Lueders Park, I seen a squad car parked
 And in her heart, she hate it there, but in her mind, she made it where
 Nothing really matters, so she hit the back seat
 'Cause Rosa Parks never a factor when she toppin' off police
 Fancy girls on Long Beach Boulevard
 Flagging down all of these flashy cars
 And Lord knows she's beautiful
 Lord knows the usuals leaving her body sore
 As she bust down like a 12-bunk on tour
 She suddenly realize she'll never escape the allure
 Of a Black man, white man needing satisfaction
 At first, it became a practice, but now she's numb to it
 Sometimes she wonder if she can do it like nuns do it
 But she never heard of Catholic religion or sinner's redemption, that sounds foolish
 And you can blame it on her mother
 For letting her boyfriend slide candy under her cover
 Ten months before she was ten, he moved in and that's when he touched her
 This motherfucker is the fuckin' reason why Keisha rushing to that
 Block away from Lueders Park, I seen an El Camino parked
 And in her heart, she hate it there, but in her mind, she made it where
 Nothing really matters, still she hit the back seat
 Then caught a knife inside the bladder, left for dead, raped in the street
 Keisha's song, mmm
 My little sister eleven, I looked her right in the face
 The day that I wrote this song, sat her down and pressed play
 Fancy girls on Long Beach Boulevard
 Flagging down all of these flashy cars
 Fancy girls on Long Beach Boulevard, oh

 Real quick, Ali
 Mmm
 Got me breathing with dragons
 I'll crack the egg in your basket, you bastard
 I'm Marilyn Manson with madness
 Now just imagine the magic I light to asses
 Don't ask for your favorite rapper
 (He dead), yes, sir (Amen), church
 (He dead), I killed him (Amen), bitch
 And this is rigamortis and it's gorgeous when you die
 Ali recorded and I'm Morpheus, the matrix of my mind
 I'm out the orbit, you an orphan and a hairdresser combined
 I'm on the toilet when I rhyme, if you the shit, then I decline
 I climax where you begin and then I end on cloud nine
 And that's important when you morph into an angel in the sky
 And don't be forging all my signatures, my listeners reply
 And tell me that you biting style, you got a hell of an appetite
 And I'ma be here for a while, just buckle up before the ride
 Or knuckle up if you can fight, we always making 'em duck or die
 A suit and tie is suitable and usual in suicide
 CSI just might investigate this fucking parasite
 (He dead, amen)
 That's what they telling me
 Aim it at your celebrity, this is studio felony
 Ferragami so many and cool enough for the '70s
 Nigga, payback's a bitch, and bitch, you been livin' in debt with me
 Dead 'em all and especially
 Leave a call on his mother voicemail that say that he rest in peace
 Bigger chopper the recipe
 Wrestling? That's irrelevant, rather rest at your residence
 Whistling to the melody, couldn't think of a better D
 Better be on your P and Q, it's just me, Jay Rock, Soul, and Q
 Solar system and barbecue, nothing else you can do
 (He dead), yup-yup (Amen), I killed him
 (He dead, amen), amen
 Got me breathing with dragons
 I'll crack the egg in your basket, you bastard
 I'm Marilyn Manson, don't ask for your favorite rapper
 (He dead), yup-yup (Amen), I know
 (He dead), for sure (Amen), amen
 Got me breathing with dragons
 I'll crack the egg in your basket, you bastard
 I'm Marilyn Manson, don't ask for your favorite rapper
 I wrapped him and made him Casper, I capture the likes of NASA
 My pedigree to fly past ya, I'll pass the weed to the pastor
 We all are sinners, won't you send us to Bible study faster?
 Your hypocritist reaction a blasphemy, I assassin my casualty
 And it's casually done, and tell 'em my salary come
 In lump sum one hundreds, don't talk to me 'bout no money
 The sun is under my feet, and I come in peace to compete
 I don't run if you'd rather leap, my statistics go up in weeks
 And I go visit the nearest creek, and I get busy on many MC
 Really ballistic, anybody can see
 Any assistance, everybody deceased
 Some persistence, recognize I be
 Really too vicious, the permanent beast
 And the demolition breaking up the street
 Better partition, better dot your T
 And I gon' mention how the far you see
 Putting my dick in the rap industry
 Everybody bitching, getting mad at me
 Recognize Kendrick in the battery
 And I'm charged up, and the catastrophe
 Is charged up, and the audacity
 Of y'all fucks never could hassle me
 And y'all luck just ran out, you'll see
 (He dead), yup-yup (Amen), I know
 (He dead), for sure (Amen), amen
 Got me breathing with dragons
 I'll crack the egg in your basket, you bastard

 Don't do it like he did, 'cause he ain't what you is
 But we can win, wait, let's get straight to the point
 To the meaning of life, what's my purpose?
 Maybe this Earth is ain't a good place to be
 How far is heaven? Let's see
 Is it in the clouds like they said it would be?
 I wonder when I die will he give me receipts?
 I wonder will the eyes of the Lord look at me?
 Look at me, look at me, I'm a loser, I'm a winner
 I'm good, I'm bad, I'm a Christian, I'm a sinner
 I'm humble, I'm loud, I'm righteous, I'm a killer
 What I'm doing? I'm saying that I'm human, now people just
 Ride to it, ride to it, 'cause you never know
 When a bullet might hit and you die to it, die to it
 Die to it, die to it, live your life, live it right
 Be different, do different things
 Don't do it like he did, 'cause he ain't what you is
 But we can win, wait, let's get straight to the point
 It go one (One), two (Two), three (Three)
 Two in the front, one in the back seat (Seat)
 Seat (Seat), seat (Seat), seat (Seat)
 Looking for a victim of a AK-47, hundred-round each, each, each
 But why must we retaliate? Is it human nature?
 I don't know, I look for the answers later
 ""Make a right, there they go"" (There they go)
 Sometimes gotta
 Ride to it, ride to it, 'cause you never know
 When a bullet might hit and you die to it, die to it
 Die to it, die to it, live your life, live it right
 Be different, do different things
 Don't do it like he did, 'cause he ain't what you is
 But we can win-win, wait, let's get straight to the point
 As I open this book and then burn up some of this reefer
 My plan is to figure out the world and escape all my demons
 I'm dying inside, I wonder if Zion inside the heavens
 A condom, a Rollie, pain, a fat blunt and a MAC-11
 That's all I see in my life and they tell me to make it right
 But I'm right on the edge of Everest and I might jump tonight
 Have you ever had known a saint that was taking sinner's advice?
 Well it's probably you, am I right? If I'm wrong, you a fucking liar
 When I lie on my back and look at the ceiling, it's so appealing to pray
 I wonder if I'm just a villain, dealing my morals away
 Some people look at my face then tell me don't worry 'bout it
 I give 'em back they deposit, no money, just total silence
 I'm running, they say I'm wildin', a youngin' with lack of guidance
 That's hundreds of us with problems
 Mo' money, mo' drugs and violence
 Look at the soul of an out-of-control artist
 That's dealing with life the hardest, that's on my life
 But regardless I'ma—
 Ride to it, ride to it, 'cause I never know
 When a bullet might hit me and I die to it, die to it
 Die to it, die to it, live my life, live it right
 Be different, do different things
 Don't do it like he did, 'cause he ain't what I is
 But we can win, wait, let's get straight to the point
 (Oh-oh, oh-oh)
 Hmm
 Yeah, life can please ya, but death can tease ya
 On the day Niko had that seizure
 I lost one of my biggest believers, aww
 Close deaths make you think about your life
 Like if I had that same chance twice, what would I do different?
 I'd tell her I loved her more, do more
 But tease her 'bout crying on that picture
 Now when I'm done recording
 Swear, I let the beat bang in her name
 Make her shake her head in heaven, saying, ""They at it again""
 Make them clouds turn to speakers
 Don't take too much smoke from the reefer
 Love being in the room with her peoples
 Now my love life murking it, family having surgeries
 Hate it that the truth that chose for they life to be under me
 Lord, what kind of life is this?
 Momma, I just wanna sing
 Momma said, ""According to get everything"" (Uh)
 ""You gotta risk everything""
 So I'm smoking my kush, reading Corinthians
 Smoking my kush, reading Corinthians
 Smoking my kush, reading Corinthians (Corinthians)

Ab-Soul's Outro,Section.80,,15,5:50,Ab-Soul,Studio,1,2 Jul 11,16,"What's your life about? Enlighten me
 Is you gon' live on your knees or die on your feet?
 It's fire in the street, fire in my Swisher
 Fire in between the two legs of your lil' sister
 Just get a sip of this elixir
 Before they crop us out the picture
 I've never seen a crop circle
 But I seen cops circle the block
 I puff squares, but I swear, one day, I'ma stop
 My nerves itch
 On the brink of my career
 While my peers struggle for employment
 Can you hear these screams?
 (Uncle Sam ain't no kin to me)
 One, two, three, four grams and a fifth of Hennessy
 A bad bitch, fuck the penitentiary
 Section 80s babies, blame Ronald Reagan
 We raising hell, hell (Oh)
 Lord forbid, the homies got wet, so we trying to soak it in
 The president is Black, but you can't vote for skin
 You vote for the better man
 Come to our show, you could see the diversity
 Unify the people, they gon' peep it universally
 We might not change the world
 But we gon' manipulate it, I hope you participatin'
 Ayo, Dot, won't you let these cats know?
 We knew we'd be here, like, back in '04
 Started HiiiPoWeR because our generation needed a generator
 In a system meant to disintegrate us (Ooh)
 And all we do is assist them
 We're not victors, we're victims
 The bigger picture isn't developed yet
 Like, what if Keisha was celibate?
 Or what if Tammy came across a real man
 Who didn't play games like children?
 My nigga cheated on his girlfriend
 With his girlfriend's girlfriend, let the world end
 And everybody tripping off 2012
 And the extraterrestrial presence as well
 (Odd Future's aight) But our future is not
 That martial law shit drop, we gon' all get got
 So keep that question mark on your face
 Eat your fast food, use your fluoride toothpaste
 Hide your feelings from the public, work your lil' nine to five
 Don't forget to pay your tithes and thank God you're alive
 HiiiPoWeR
 And on another note
 We focused like the Hubble Telescope
 Soul
 Life is a traffic jam, life is a traffic jam
 (Life is a traffic jam)
 Life is a traffic jam, life is a traffic jam
 Life is a traffic jam, life is a traffic jam
 (I'm ready to go, ready to go)
 Life is a traffic jam, life is a traffic jam
 (Ready to go, ready to go)
 Life is a traffic jam
 Life...
 I wrote this because I was ordered to
 People say I speak for generation Y
 Why lie? I do, Section.80
 Your son'll play me if radio won't
 Daughters that just turn one 'til twenty-one listen to Kendrick
 For instance
 What's your life about? Enlighten me
 Is you gon' live on your knees or die on your feet?
 Take out that student loan, and pay off your college degree
 And do exactly what you see on TV
 True story
 Hmm
 Can you repeat that for me, Soul?
 What's your life about? Enlighten me
 Is you gon' live on your knees or die on your feet?
 Is you gon' plead the fifth or sound the horn?
 The time is now, my child, come on
 See, a lot of y'all don't understand Kendrick Lamar
 Because you wonder how I could talk about money, hoes, clothes, God, and history all in the same sentence
 You know what all them things have in common?
 Only half of the truth, if you tell it
 See I spent twenty-three years on this earth searching for answers
 'Til one day I realized I had to come up with my own
 I'm not on the outside looking in
 I'm not on the inside looking out
 I'm in the dead fucking center, looking around
 You ever seen a newborn baby kill a grown man?
 That's an analogy for the way the world make me react
 My innocence been dead
 So, the next time I talk about money, hoes, clothes, God, and history all in the same sentence
 Just know I meant it, and you felt it
 'Cause you too are searching for answers
 I'm not the next pop star, I'm not the next socially-aware rapper
 I am a human motherfuckin' being over dope-ass instrumentation
 Kendrick Lamar
 Now fuck 'em up, Terrace
 (Soul)
 I watch this fire that we’re gathered around
 And see that it burns similar to the fire that’s inside you
 Section.80
 Section.80 babies
 A generation of bliss and disobedience
 No, they can't control us
 No, they can't control you
 No, they can't control us
 But we can control each other
 We build our own world
 If you don't leave with nothing else tonight
 You will leave with knowing yourself
 You will leave knowing that you represent something that's bigger than all of us
 Our family
 Heart, honor, and respect
 This is you
 This is me

HiiiPoWeR,Section.80,,16,4:39,,Studio,1,2 Jul 11,16,"Everybody put three fingers in the air
 The sky is falling, the wind is calling
 Stand for something or die in the morning
 Section.80, HiiiPoWeR
 Visions of Martin Luther staring at me
 Malcolm X put a hex on my future, someone catch me
 I'm falling victim to a revolutionary song, the Serengeti's clone
 Back to put you backstabbers back on your spinal bone
 You slipped your disc when I slid you my disc
 You wanted to diss, but jumped on my dick
 Grown men never should bite their tongue
 Unless you eatin' pussy that smell like it's a stale plum
 I got my finger on the motherfuckin' pistol
 Aimin' it at a pig, Charlotte's web is gonna miss you
 My issue isn't televised and you ain't gotta tell the wise
 How to stay on beat, because our life's an instrumental
 This is physical and mental, I won't sugarcoat it
 You'd die from diabetes if these other niggas wrote it
 And everything on TV just a figment of imagination
 I don't want a plastic nation, dread that like a Haitian
 While you motherfuckers waiting, I be off the slave ship
 Building pyramids, writing my own hieroglyphs
 Just call the shit HiiiPoWeR
 Nigga, nothing less than HiiiPoWeR
 Five-star dishes, food for thought, bitches
 I mean this shit is
 Huey Newton going stupid, you can't resist his
 HiiiPoWeR
 Throw your hands up for HiiiPoWeR
 Visions of Martin Luther staring at me
 If I see it how he seen it, that would make my parents happy
 Sorry, mama, I can't turn the other cheek
 They wanna knock me off the edge like a fuckin' widow's peak, uh
 And she always told me pray for the weak, uh
 Them demons got me, I ain't prayed in some weeks, uh
 Dear Lord, come save me, the devil's working hard
 He probably clockin' double shifts on all of his jobs
 Frightenin', so fuckin' frightenin'
 Enough to drive a man insane, I need a license to kill
 I'm standing on a field full of land mines
 Doin' the moonwalk, hopin' I blow up in time
 'Cause 2012 might not be a fuckin' legend
 Tryna be a fuckin' legend, the man of mankind
 Who said a Black man in the Illuminati?
 Last time I checked, that was the biggest racist party
 So get up off that slave ship
 Build your own pyramids, write your own hieroglyphs
 Just call the shit HiiiPoWeR
 Nigga, nothing less than HiiiPoWeR
 Five-star dishes, food for thought, bitches
 I mean this shit is
 Bobby Seale makin' meals, you can't resist his
 HiiiPoWeR
 Throw your hands up for HiiiPoWeR
 Every day, we fight the system just to make our way
 We been down for too long, but that's alright
 We was built to be strong, 'cause it's our life, na-na-na
 Every day, we fight the system, we fight the system
 We fight the system (Never like the system)
 We been down for too long, but that's alright, na-na-na
 Who said a Black man in the Illuminati?
 Last time I checked, that was the biggest racist party
 Last time I checked, we was racin' with Marcus Garvey
 On the freeway to Africa 'til I wreck my Audi
 And I want everybody to view my autopsy
 So you can see exactly where the government had shot me
 No conspiracy, my fate is inevitable
 They play musical chairs once I'm on that pedestal
 Frightenin', so fuckin' frightenin'
 Enough to drive a man insane, a woman insane
 The reason Lauryn Hill don't sing, or Kurt Cobain
 Loaded that clip and then said bang
 The drama it bring is crazy, product of the late '80s
 Tryna stay above water, that's why we shun the Navy
 Pull your guns and play me, let's set it off
 'Cause a riot, throw a Molotov
 Somebody told me them pirates had got lost
 'Cause we been off them slave ships
 Got our own pyramids, write our own hieroglyphs
 Just call the shit HiiiPoWeR
 Yeah, nothing less than HiiiPoWeR
 Five-star dishes, food for thought, bitches
 I mean this shit is
 Fred Hampton on your campus, you can't resist his

Sherane a.k.a Master Splinter's Daughter,"good kid, m.A.A.d city",A Short Film by Kendrick Lamar,1,4:33,,Studio,2,22 Oct 12,12,"Lord God, I come to you a sinner
 And I humbly repent for my sins
 I believe that Jesus is Lord
 I believe that You raised him from the dead
 I would ask that Jesus come to my life
 And be my Lord and Savior
 I receive Jesus to take control of my life
 And that I may live for him from this day forth
 Thank you, Lord Jesus, for saving me with your precious blood
 In Jesus' name, amen
 I met her at this house party on El Segundo and Central
 She had the credentials of strippers in Atlanta
 Ass came with a hump, from the jump she was a camel
 I want to ride like Arabians, push an '04 Mercedes-Benz
 ""Hello, my name is Kendrick,"" she said, ""No, you're handsome""
 Whispered in my ear, disappeared, then found her dancin'
 Ciara had played in the background
 The parade music we made had us all wearin' shades now, cool
 ""Where you stay?"" She said, ""Down the street from Dominguez High""
 Okay, I know that's borderline Compton or Paramount
 ""Well, is it Compton?"" ""No,"" she replied
 Then quickly start battin' her eyes
 I strictly had wanted her thighs around me
 Seventeen with nothin' but pussy stuck on my mental
 My motive was rather sinful, ""What you tryna get into?""
 She didn't tell, just gave me her Nextel
 Dropped the number, we chirped the whole summer, and, well
 The summer had passed, and now I'm likin' her
 Conversation we havin' probably enticin' her
 Who can imagine? Maybe my actions'll end up wifin' her
 Love or lust, regardless, we'll fuck 'cause the trife in us
 It's deep-rooted, the music of bein' young and dumb
 Is never muted, in fact, it's much louder where I'm from
 We know a lot 'bout each other, her mother was a crack addict
 She live with her granny and her younger two brothers
 Her favorite cousin Demetrius is irrepetible
 Family history of gangbangin' did make me skeptical
 But not enough to stop me from gettin' a nut
 ""I wanna come over, what's up?""
 That's what I told her soon as this episode
 Of Martin go off, I'm tryna get off
 I was in heat like a cactus
 My tactics of bein' thirsty probably could hurt me
 But fuck it, I got some heart
 Grabbed my mama keys, hopped in the car, then, oh boy
 So now I'm down Rosecrans in a Caravan
 Passin' Alameda, my gas meter in need of a pump
 I got enough to get me through the traffic jam
 At least I hope, 'cause my pockets broke as a promise, man
 I'm thinkin' 'bout that sex
 Thinkin' 'bout her thighs or maybe kissin' on her neck or maybe what position's next
 Sent a picture of her titties, blowin' up my texts
 I looked at 'em and almost ran my front bumper into Corvette
 Enthused by the touch of a woman, she's a masseuse
 And I'm a professional pornstar when off the Goose
 I had a fifth in the trunk like Curtis Jackson for ransom
 I'm hopin' to get her loose like an Uncle Luke anthem
 I'm two blocks away, two hundred and fifty feet
 And six steps from where she stay, she wavin' me 'cross the street
 I pulled up, a smile on my face, and then I see
 Two niggas, two black hoodies, I froze as my phone rang
 Please leave your message for three-two-three
 Record your message after the tone
 Kendrick, where you at?
 Damn, I'm sittin' here waitin' on my van
 You told me you was gon' be back in fifteen minutes
 Man, I gotta go up to the county buildin', man, these kids ready to eat
 I'm ready to eat, shit
 I gotta get them food stamps, come on now
 You on your way or what?
 I hope you ain't out there messin' with them damn hoodrats out there, shit
 'Specially that lil' crazy-ass girl Sherane
 And plus you got school tomorrow
 You keep fuckin' around in them streets, you ain't gon' pass to the next grade
 Eleventh grade
 (Is that Kendrick on the phone?)
 Your daddy callin' about some damn dominoes (Let me holler at him)
 He want to holler at you too, go ahead, Kenny, go'n, shit
 Hello? Yak, where my motherfuckin' dominoes at?
 (Kenny), What?
 I'm on his voicemail, damn fool (Oh), shit
 Yak, where my motherfuckin' dominoes at?
 This the second time I asked you to bring my fuckin' dominoes
 Just give me the damn phone, shit, don't hang up, damn, let me
 Kendrick, when you get this message, man, call me back (Keep losin' my goddamn dominoes, we gon' have to go in the backyard)
 I need to know when you gon' bring back my damn car (And squab, homie)
 This man fussin' 'bout some damn dominoes
 It ain't all that serious, fuck, damn dominoes
 Shit, I'ma miss my damn appointment, fuck
 Fuck some damn dominoes, nobody wanna hear that

"Bitch, Don't Kill My Vibe","good kid, m.A.A.d city",A Short Film by Kendrick Lamar,2,5:10,,Studio,2,22 Oct 12,12,"I am a sinner who's probably gonna sin again
 Lord, forgive me
 Lord, forgive me
 Things I don't understand
 Sometimes I need to be alone
 Bitch, don't kill my vibe
 Bitch, don't kill my vibe
 I can feel your energy from two planets away
 I got my drink, I got my music
 I would share it, but today I'm yelling
 Bitch, don't kill my vibe
 Bitch, don't kill my vibe
 Bitch, don't kill my vibe
 Bitch, don't kill my vibe
 Look inside of my soul and you can find gold and maybe get rich
 Look inside of your soul and you can find out it never exist
 I can feel the changes
 I can feel a new life, I always knew life can be dangerous
 I can say that I like a challenge and you tell me it's painless
 You don't know what pain is
 How can I paint this picture
 When the color blind is hangin' with you?
 Fell on my face and awoke with a scar
 Another mistake livin' deep in my heart
 Wear it on top of my sleeve in a flick
 I can admit that it did look like yours
 Why you resent every making of his?
 Tell me your purpose is petty again
 But even a small lighter can burn a bridge
 Even a small lighter can burn a bridge
 I can feel the changes
 I can feel the new people around me just want to be famous
 You can see that my city found me
 Then put me on stages, to me that's amazin'
 To you that's a quick check
 With all disrespect, let me say this
 I am a sinner who's probably gonna sin again
 Lord, forgive me
 Lord, forgive me
 Things I don't understand
 Sometimes I need to be alone
 Bitch, don't kill my vibe! Bitch, don't kill my vibe!
 I can feel your energy from two planets away
 I got my drink, I got my music
 I would share it, but today I'm yelling
 Bitch, don't kill my vibe
 Bitch, don't kill my vibe
 Bitch, don't kill my vibe
 Bitch, don't kill my vibe
 I'm tryin' to keep it alive
 And not compromise the feeling we love
 You're tryin' to keep it deprived
 And only co-sign what radio does
 And I'm lookin' right past you
 We live in a world, we live in a world on two different axles
 You live in a world, you livin' behind the mirror
 I know what you scared of
 The feeling of feeling emotions inferior
 This shit is vital, I know you had to
 This shit is vital, I know you had to
 Die in a pitiful vain, tell me a watch and a chain
 Is way more believable, give me a feasible gain
 Rather a seasonal name
 I'll let the people know this is somethin' you can blame
 On yourselves, you can remain stuck in a box
 I'ma break out and then hide every lock
 I'ma break out and then hide every lock
 I can feel the changes
 I can feel the new people around me just want to be famous
 You can see that my city found me, then put me on stages
 To me, that's amazin'
 To you that's a quick check
 With all disrespect, let me say this
 I am a sinner who's probably gonna sin again
 Lord, forgive me
 Lord, forgive me
 Things I don't understand
 Sometimes I need to be alone
 Bitch, don't kill my vibe
 Bitch, don't kill my vibe
 I can feel your energy from two planets away
 I got my drink, I got my music
 I would share it, but today I'm yelling
 Bitch, don't kill my vibe
 Bitch, don't kill my vibe
 Bitch, don't kill my vibe
 Bitch, don't kill my vibe
 Bitch, don't kill my vibe
 You ain't heard the coast like this in a long time
 Don't you see that long line?
 And they waiting on Kendrick like the first and the fifteenth
 Threes in the air, I can see you are in sync
 Hide your feelings, hide your feelings, now, what you better do
 I'll take your girlfriend and put that pussy on the pedestal
 Bitch, don't kill my vibe
 Bitch, don't kill my vibe
 Walk out the door and they scream it's alive
 My New Year's resolution is to stop all the pollution
 Talk too motherfuckin' much, I got my drink, I got my music
 I say bitch, don't kill my vibe
 Bitch, don't kill my vibe
 Bitch, don't kill my vibe
 Bitch, don't kill my vibe
 Ayy, K-Dot, get in the car, nigga!
 Come on, we finna roll out!

 Martin had a dream
 Kendrick have a dream
 All my life I want money and power
 Respect my mind or die from lead shower
 I pray my dick get big as the Eiffel Tower
 So I can fuck the world for seventy-two hours
 Goddamn I feel amazin', damn, I'm in the Matrix
 My mind is livin' on cloud nine and this 9 is never on vacation
 Start up that Maserati and – vroom-vroom! – I'm racin'
 Poppin' pills in the lobby and I pray they don't find her naked
 And I pray you niggas is hatin', shooters go after Judas
 Jesus Christ, if I live life on my knees ain't no need to do this
 Park it in front of Lueders, next to that Church's Chicken
 All you pussies is losers, all my niggas is winners, screamin'—
 All my life I want money and power
 Respect my mind or die from lead shower
 I pray my dick get big as the Eiffel Tower
 So I can fuck the world for seventy-two hours
 Goddamn I got bitches, damn I got bitches
 Damn I got bitches: wifey, girlfriend and mistress
 All my life I want money and power
 Respect my mind or die from lead showers
 I've got 25 lighters on my dresser, yessir
 Put fire to that ass, body cast on a stretcher
 And her body got that ass that a ruler couldn't measure
 And it make me cum fast, but I never get embarrassed
 And I recognize you have what I've been wantin' since that record
 That Adina Howard had pop it fast to impress her
 She rollin', I'm holdin' my scrotum and posin'
 This voice here is golden, so fuck y'all, I goes in, and—
 All my life I want money and power
 Respect my mind or die from lead shower
 I pray my dick get big as the Eiffel Tower
 So I can fuck the world for seventy-two hours
 Goddamn I got bitches, damn I got bitches
 Damn I got bitches: wifey, girlfriend and mistress
 All my life I want money and power
 Respect my mind or, nigga, it's go time
 I roll in dough with a good grind
 And I run at ho with a baton
 That's a relay race with a bouquet
 They say, ""K, you goin' marry mines.""
 Beeotch! No way, beeotch! No way
 Beeotch! No way, beeotch! Okay
 I'm never livin' life confined
 As I feel you even if I'm blind
 I can tell you who, what, when, where
 How to sell your game right on time
 Beeotch! Go play, beeotch! Go play
 Beeotch! Go play, beeotch! I look like OJ
 Killin' everything from pussy to a mothafuckin' Hit-Boy beat
 She pussy poppin' and I got options like an audible, I be
 C-O-M-P-T-O-N, I win, then ball at your defeat
 C-O-M-P-T-O-N, my city, mobbin' in the street, yellin'—

The Art of Peer Pressure,"good kid, m.A.A.d city",A Short Film by Kendrick Lamar,4,5:24,,Studio,2,22 Oct 12,12,"Everybody, everybody, everybody
 Everybody sit yo bitch-ass down
 And listen to this true mothafuckin' story
 Told by Kendrick Lamar on Rosecrans, ya bitch
 Smokin' on the finest dope, ay-ay-ay-ah
 Drank until I can't no mo', ay-ay-ay-ah
 Really I'm a sober soul
 But I'm with the homies right now
 And we ain't askin' for no favors
 Rush a nigga quick, then laugh about it later, ay-ay-ay-ah
 Really, I'm a peacemaker
 But I'm with the homies right now
 And Mama used to say (Say, say, say, say)
 One day it's gon' burn you out (Woo)
 One day it's gon' burn you out, out, out
 One day it's gon' burn you out (You, you, you, you, you, you)
 One day it's gon' burn you
 But I'm with the homies right now
 Me and my niggas four deep in a white Toyota
 A quarter tank of gas, one pistol, an orange soda
 Janky stash box when the federales'll roll up
 Basketball shorts with the Gonzales Park odor
 We on the mission for bad bitches and trouble
 I hope the universe love you today
 'Cause the energy we bringin' sure to carry away
 A flock of positive activists that fill they body with hate
 If it's necessary; bumpin' Jeezy first album, lookin' distracted
 Speakin' language only we know, you think it's an accent
 The windows roll down, all I see is a hand pass it
 Hotboxin' like George Foreman grillin' the masses
 Of the workin' world; we pulled up on a bunch of workin' girls
 And asked them what they workin' with
 Look at me, I got the blunt in my mouth
 Usually I'm drug-free, but, shit, I'm with the homies
 Yeah, nigga, we off a pill and Remy Red
 Come through and bust ya head, nigga!
 Me and the homies
 Sag all the way to the liquor store
 Where my niggas pour up 4 and get twisted some more
 Me and the homies
 I ride for my mothafuckin' niggas
 Hop out, do my stuff, then hop back in
 Me and the homies
 Matter of fact, I hop out that mothafucka
 And be like ""doo-doo-doo-doot, doo-doo-doo-doo-doot!”
 It's 2:30 and the sun is beamin'
 Air conditioner broke and I hear my stomach screamin'
 Hungry for anything unhealthy
 And if nutrition can help me
 I'll tell you to suck my dick, then I'll continue eatin'
 We speedin' on the 405, passin' Westchester
 You know, the light-skinned girls in all the little dresses
 Good Lord, they knew we weren't from 'round there
 'Cause every time we down there
 We pullin' out the Boost Mobile SIM cards
 Bougie bitches with no extensions
 Hood niggas with bad intentions, the perfect combination
 Before we sparked a conversation
 We seen three niggas in colors we didn't like
 Then started interrogatin'
 I never was a gangbanger, I mean
 I never was stranger to the fonk neither, I really doubt it
 Rush a nigga quick and then we laugh about it
 That's ironic, 'cause I've never been violent
 Until I'm with the homies
 (Just ridin', just ridin')
 Me and the homies
 (Bullshittin', actin' a fool)
 Me and the homies
 (Trippin', really trippin')
 Me and the homies
 (Just ridin', just ridin', just ridin')
 Braggin' 'bout the episode we just had
 A shot of Hennessy didn't make me feel that bad
 I'm usually a true firm believer of bad karma
 Consequences from evil will make your past haunt ya
 We tryna conquer the city with disobedience
 Quick to turn it up, even if we ain't got the CD in
 But Jeezy still playin'
 And our attitude is still ""nigga, what is you sayin'?""
 Pull in front of the house
 That we been campin' out for like two months
 The sun is goin' down as we take whatever we want
 Ayy, ayy, nigga, jackpot, nigga, pop the safe!
 Ayy, nigga, I think there's somebody in this room!
 Wait, what?!
 Nigga, there's somebody in this room!
 I hit the back window in search of any Nintendo
 DVDs, plasma-screen TVs in the trunk
 We made a right, then made a left, then made a right
 Then made a left, we was just circlin' life
 My mama called: ""Hello? What you doin'?"" — ""Kickin' it.""
 I shoulda told her I'm probably 'bout to catch my first offense
 With the homies
 But – they made a right, then made a left
 Then made a right, then another right
 One lucky night with the homies
 K-Dot, you faded, hood?
 Yeah, we finally got that nigga faded
 I think he hit the wrong blunt though
 Ooh, which one?
 Well, which one he talkin' about?
 I was finna hit the one with the shenanigans in it
 I pray he ain't hit that
 Nah, that nigga straight, he ain't hit that one
 Got the shenanigans? Give that nigga the shenanigans!
 Nigga, I think we should push back to the city, fo' real doe
 Nigga, for what?
 What that nigga— what's that Jeezy song say, nigga?
 ""Last time I checked I was the man on these streets!""
 Yeah, yeah, that shit right there
 I'm tryna be the nigga in the street
 There he go. Man, you don't even know how the shit go
 Look, here's the plan, luv
 We gon' use the kickback as a alibi, wait 'til the sun go down, roll out, complete the mission, drop K-Dot off at his mama van, at the park
 'Cause I know he tryna fuck on Sherane tonight
 That's what he's not gon' do
 Then we all gon' meet back at the block at about 10:30
 That's straight, but we should meet up around 12
 I'm tryna fuck on somethin' too
 Nigga, sit yo dumb-ass back down!
 Nigga, you ain't doin' shit tonight!
 Matter of fact, nigga, get in the mothafuckin' car!

 Drop that work up in the bushes
 Hope them boys don't see my stash

 This the last time you might see my ass
 From the gardens where the grass ain't cut
 Them serpents lurkin', Blood
 Bitches sellin' pussy, niggas sellin' drugs
 But it's all good
 Broken promises, steal your watch
 And tell you what time it is
 Take your J's and tell you to kick it where a FootLocker is

Poetic Justice,"good kid, m.A.A.d city",A Short Film by Kendrick Lamar,6,5:00,Drake,Studio,2,22 Oct 12,12,"Every second, every minute
 Man, I swear that she can get it
 Say if you a bad bitch, put your hands up high
 Hands up high, hands up high
 Tell 'em dim the lights down right now
 Put me in the mood
 I'm talkin' about dark room, perfume, go, go
 I recognize your fragrance
 Hold up, you ain't never gotta say shit
 Uh, and I know your taste is
 A little bit, hmm, high maintenance
 Uh, everybody else basic
 You live life on an everyday basis
 With poetic justice, poetic justice
 If I told you that a flower bloomed in a dark room
 Would you trust it?
 I mean, I write poems in these songs dedicated to you when
 You're in the mood for empathy, there's blood in my pen
 Better yet, where your friends and 'em?
 I really wanna know you all
 I really wanna show you off
 Fuck that, pour up plenty of champagne
 Cold nights when you curse this name
 You called up your girlfriends
 And y'all curled in that little bitty Range
 I heard that she wanna go and party, she wanna go and party
 Nigga, don't approach her with that Atari
 Nigga, that ain't good game, homie, sorry
 They say conversation rule a nation, I can tell
 But I could never right my wrongs
 'Less I write it down for real, P.S.
 You can get it, you can get it
 You can get it, you can get it
 And I know just, know just, know just
 Know just, know just what you want
 Poetic justice, put it in a song, alright
 You can get it, you can get it
 You can get it, you can get it
 And I know just, know just, know just
 Know just, know just what you want
 Poetic justice, put it in a song, alright
 I really hope you play this, 'cause ol' girl, you test my patience
 With all these seductive photographs
 And all these one-off vacations you've been takin'
 Clearly a lot for me to take in, it don't make sense
 Young East African girl, you too busy fuckin' with your other man
 I was tryna put you on game, put you on a plane
 Take you and your momma to the motherland
 I could do it, maybe one day
 When you figure out you're gonna need someone
 When you figure out it's alright here in the city
 And you don't run from where we come from
 That sound like poetic justice, poetic justice
 You were so new to this life, but goddamn, you got adjusted
 I mean, I write poems in these songs, dedicated to the fun sex
 Your natural hair and your soft skin
 And your big ass in that sundress, ooh
 Good God, what you doin' that walk for?
 When I see that thing move
 I just wish we would fight less and we would talk more
 They say communication save relations, I can tell
 But I can never right my wrongs
 Unless I write 'em down for real, P.S.
 You can get it, you can get it
 You can get it, you can get it
 And I know just, know just, know just
 Know just, know just what you want
 Poetic justice, put it in a song, alright
 You can get it, you can get it
 You can get it, you can get it
 And I know just, know just, know just
 Know just, know just what you want
 Poetic justice, put it in a song, alright
 Every time I write these words they become a taboo
 Makin' sure my punctuation curve, every letter here's true
 Livin' my life in the margin and that metaphor was proof
 I'm talkin' poetic justice, poetic justice
 If I told you that a flower bloomed in a dark room
 Would you trust it? I mean, you need to hear this
 Love is not just a verb, it's you lookin' in the mirror
 Love is not just a verb, it's you lookin' for it, maybe
 Call me crazy, we can both be insane
 A fatal attraction is common, and what we have common is pain
 I mean, you need to hear this, love is not just a verb
 And I can see power steerin', sex drive when you swerve
 I want that interference, it's coherent, I can hear it
 Uh-huh, that's your heartbeat
 It either caught me or it called me, uh-huh
 Read slow and you'll find gold mines in these lines
 Sincerely, yours truly, and right before you go blind, P.S.
 You can get it, you can get it
 You can get it, you can get it
 And I know just, know just, know just
 Know just, know just what you want
 Poetic justice, put it in a song
 I'm gon' ask you one more time, homie
 Where is you from? Where is he from? (Ay ay ay ay ay, ask him if he came over for Sherane.)
 Ayy, you over here for Sherane, homie?
 Yo, I don't care who this nigga over here for,
 If he don't tell me where he from, it's a wrap! I'm sorry.
 Hol' up, hol' up, hol' up, we gon' do it like this, okay?
 I'ma tell you where I'm from, okay?
 You gon' tell me where you from, okay?
 Or where your grandma stay, where your mama stay, or where your daddy stay, okay?
 Enough with all this talkin'.

good kid,"good kid, m.A.A.d city",A Short Film by Kendrick Lamar,7,3:34,,Studio,2,22 Oct 12,12,"Mass hallucination, baby
 Ill education, baby
 Want to reconnect with your elations?
 This is your station, baby
 Look inside these walls and you see I'm havin' withdrawals
 Of a prisoner on his way
 Trapped inside your desire to fire bullets that stray
 Track attire just tell you I'm tired and ran away
 I should ask a choir: ""What do you require
 To sing a song that acquire me to have faith?""
 As the record spin I should pray
 For the record, I recognize that I'm easily prey
 I got ate alive yesterday
 I got animosity buildin', it's prob'ly big as a buildin'
 Me jumpin' off of the roof is me just playin' it safe
 But what am I 'posed to do when the topic is red or blue
 And you understand that I ain't
 But know I'm accustomed to just a couple that look for trouble
 And live in the street with rank
 No better picture to paint than me walkin' from bible study
 And called his homies because he had said he noticed my face
 From a function that tooken place, they was wonderin' if I bang
 Step on my neck and get blood on your Nike checks
 I don't mind 'cause one day you'll respect
 The good kid, m.A.A.d city
 Mass hallucination, baby
 Ill education, baby
 Want to reconnect with your elations?
 This is your station, baby
 All I see is strobe lights, blindin' me in my hindsight
 Findin' me by myself, promise me you can help
 In all honesty I got time to be copacetic until
 You had finally made decision to hold me against my will
 It was like a head-on collision that folded me standing still
 I can never pick out the difference and grade a cop on the bill
 Every time you clock in the morning, I feel you just want to kill
 All my innocence while ignorin' my purpose to persevere
 As a better person; I know you heard this and probably in fear
 But what am I 'posed to do when the blinkin' of red and blue
 Flash from the top of your roof and your dog has to say woof
 And you ask: ""Lift up your shirt,"" because you wonder if a tattoo
 Of affiliation can make it a pleasure to put me through
 Gang files, but that don't matter because the matter is racial profile
 I heard 'em chatter: ""He's prob'ly young, but I know that he's down
 Step on his neck as hard as your bullet-proof vest
 He don't mind, he know we'll never respect
 The good kid, m.A.A.d city.""
 Mass hallucination, baby
 Ill education, baby
 Want to reconnect with your elations?
 This is your station, baby
 All I see in this room: 20s, Xannies and these 'shrooms
 Grown-up candy for pain, can we live in a sane
 Society? It's entirely stressful upon my brain
 You hired me as a victim, I quietly hope for change
 When violence is the rhythm, inspired me to obtain
 The silence in this room with 20s, Xannies and 'shrooms
 Some grown-up candy, I lost it, I feel it's nothin' to lose
 The streets sure to release the worst side of my best
 Don't mind, 'cause now you ever in debt to good kid, m.A.A.d city
 Mass hallucination, baby

m.A.A.d city,"good kid, m.A.A.d city",A Short Film by Kendrick Lamar,8,5:50,MC Eiht,Studio,2,22 Oct 12,12,"If Pirus and Crips all got along
 They'd probably gun me down by the end of this song
 Seem like the whole city go against me
 Every time I'm in the street, I hear—
 Yawk! Yawk! Yawk! Yawk!
 Man down, where you from, nigga?
 Fuck who you know—where you from, my nigga?
 Where your grandma stay, huh, my nigga?
 This m.A.A.d city I run, my nigga
 Brace yourself, I'll take you on a trip down memory lane
 This is not a rap on how I'm slingin' crack or move cocaine
 This is cul-de-sac and plenty Cognac and major pain
 Not the drill sergeant, but the stress that weighin' on your brain
 It was me, L Boog, and Yan Yan, YG Lucky ride down Rosecrans
 It got ugly, wavin' yo' hand out the window – check yourself!
 Uh, Warriors and Conans, hope euphoria can slow dance
 With society, the driver seat the first one to get killed
 Seen a light-skinned nigga with his brains blown out
 At the same burger stand where *beep* hang out
 Now this is not a tape recorder sayin' that he did it
 But ever since that day, I was lookin' at him different
 That was back when I was nine, Joey packed the nine
 Pakistan on every porch is fine, we adapt to crime
 Pack a van with four guns at a time
 With the sliding door, fuck is up?
 Fuck you shootin' for if you ain't walkin' up, you fuckin' punk?
 Pickin' up the fuckin' pump, pickin' off you suckers
 Suck a dick or die or sucker punch
 A wall of bullets comin' from AK's, AR's, ""Ayy, y'all—duck!""
 That's what Momma said when we was eatin' that free lunch
 Aw man, goddamn, all hell broke loose
 You killed my cousin back in '94, fuck yo' truce!
 Now crawl your head in that noose
 You wind up dead on the news
 Ain't no peace treaty, just piecin' BGs up to pre-approve
 Bodies on top of bodies, IVs on top of IVs
 Obviously the coroner between the sheets like the Isleys
 When you hop on that trolley, make sure your color's correct
 Make sure you're corporate or they'll be callin' your mother collect
 They say the governor collect all of our taxes, except
 When we in traffic and tragic happens, that shit ain't no threat
 You movin' backwards if you suggest that you sleep with a TEC
 Go buy a chopper and have a doctor on speed dial, I guess
 m.A.A.d city
 Man down, where you from, nigga?
 Fuck who you know—where you from, my nigga?
 Where your grandma stay, huh, my nigga?
 This m.A.A.d city I run, my nigga
 If Pirus and Crips all got along
 They'd probably gun me down by the end of this song
 Seem like the whole city go against me
 Every time I'm in the street, I hear—
 Yawk! Yawk! Yawk!—
 Wake yo' punk-ass up!
 It ain't nothin' but a Compton thang
 G-yeah, real simple and plain
 Let me teach you some lessons about the street
 (Smoke somethin', nigga!)
 Hood ('Sup, Cuz?)
 It ain't nothin' but a Compton thang
 G-yeah, how we do
 Fresh outta school 'cause I was a high school grad'
 Sleepin' in the living room of my momma's pad
 Reality struck, I seen the white car crash
 Hit the light pole, two niggas hopped out on foot and dashed
 My pops said I needed a job, I thought I believed him
 Security guard for a month and ended up leavin'
 In fact, I got fired, 'cause I was inspired by all of my friends
 To stage a robbery the third Saturday I clocked in
 Projects tore up, gang signs get thrown up
 Cocaine laced in marijuana
 And they wonder why I rarely smoke now
 Imagine if your first blunt had you foamin' at the mouth
 I was straight tweakin', the next weekend we broke even
 I made allegiance that made a promise to see you bleedin'
 You know the reasons but still will never know my life
 Kendrick a.k.a. ""Compton's Human Sacrifice""
 G-yeah, cocaine, weed
 Niggas been mixin' shit since the '80s, loc
 Sherm sticks, butt-nakeds
 Dip, make a nigga flip
 Cluck heads all up and down the block and shit
 One time's crooked and shit
 Block a nigga in
 Alondra, Rosecrans, Bullis, it's Compton
 I'm still in the hood, loc, yeah that's cool
 Shit, the hood took me under, so I follow the rules
 But yeah, that's like me, I grew up in the hood where they bang
 And niggas that rep colors is doin' the same thang
 Pass it to the left so I can smoke on me
 A couple drive-bys in the hood lately, shit
 Couple of IV's with the fuckin' spray-can
 Shots in the crowd, then everybody ran
 Crew I'm finna slay, the street life I crave
 Shots hit the enemy, hearts turn brave
 Mount up, regulators in the whip
 Down the boulevard with the pistol grip, yeah
 Trip, we in the hood still
 So, loc, grab a strap 'cause yeah, it's so real, yeah
 Deal with the outcome, a strap in the hand
 And a bird and ten grand's where a mothafucka stand
 If I told you I killed a nigga at sixteen, would you believe me?
 Perceive me to be innocent Kendrick you seen in the street
 With a basketball and some Now and Laters to eat?
 If I mentioned all of my skeletons, would you jump in the seat?
 Would you say my intelligence now is great relief?
 And it's safe to say that our next generation maybe can sleep
 With dreams of bein' a lawyer or doctor
 Instead of boy with a chopper that hold the cul-de-sac hostage
 Kill 'em all if they gossip
 The Children of the Corn, they vandalizin' the option
 Of livin' a lie, drown their body with toxins
 Constantly drinkin' and drive
 Hit the powder, then watch this flame that arrive in his eye
 Listen, coward, the concept is aim and then bang it and slide
 Out that bitch with deposit, a price on his head, the tithes
 Probably go to the projects, I
 Live inside the belly of the rough, Compton, USA
 Made me an Angel on Angel Dust - what?
 ​m.A.A.d city
 Compton
 Nigga, pass Dot the bottle, damn!
 You ain't the one that got fucked up
 What you holdin' it for?

Swimming Pools (Drank),"good kid, m.A.A.d city",A Short Film by Kendrick Lamar,9,5:13,,Studio,2,22 Oct 12,12,"Pour up (drank), head shot (drank)
 Sit down (drank), stand up (drank)
 Pass out (drank), wake up (drank)
 Faded (drank), faded (drank)
 Now I done grew up 'round some people livin' their life in bottles
 Granddaddy had the golden flask
 Backstroke every day in Chicago
 Some people like the way it feels
 Some people wanna kill their sorrows
 Some people wanna fit in with the popular, that was my problem
 I was in a dark room, loud tunes
 Lookin' to make a vow soon
 That I'ma get fucked up, fillin' up my cup I see the crowd mood
 Changin' by the minute and the record on repeat
 Took a sip, then another sip, then somebody said to me
 Nigga, why you babysittin' only two or three shots?
 I'ma show you how to turn it up a notch
 First you get a swimming pool full of liquor, then you dive in it
 Pool full of liquor, then you dive in it
 I wave a few bottles, then I watch 'em all flock
 All the girls wanna play Baywatch
 I got a swimming pool full of liquor and they dive in it
 Po-Pool full of liquor, I'ma dive in it
 Pour up (drank), head shot (drank)
 Sit down (drank), stand up (drank)
 Pass out (drank), wake up (drank)
 Faded (drank), faded (drank)
 Okay, now open your mind up and listen me, Kendrick
 I am your conscience, if you do not hear me
 Then you will be history, Kendrick
 I know that you're nauseous right now
 And I'm hopin' to lead you to victory, Kendrick
 If I take another one down
 I'ma drown in some poison, abusin' my limit
 I think that I'm feelin' the vibe, I see the love in her eyes
 I see the feelin', the freedom is granted
 As soon as the damage of vodka arrived
 This how you capitalize, this is parental advice
 Then apparently, I'm over-influenced by what you are doin'
 I thought I was doin' the most 'til someone said to me
 Nigga, why you babysittin' only two or three shots?
 I'ma show you how to turn it up a notch
 First you get a swimming pool full of liquor, then you dive in it
 Pool full of liquor, then you dive in it
 I wave a few bottles, then I watch 'em all flock

 Pass out (drank), wake up (drank)
 Faded (drank), faded (drank)
 I ride, you ride, bang
 One chopper, one hundred shots, bang
 Hop out, do you bang?
 Two chopper, two hundred shots, bang
 I ride, you ride, bang
 One chopper, one hundred shots, bang
 Hop out, do you bang?
 Two chopper, two hundred shots, bang
 Nigga, why you babysittin' only two or three shots?
 I'ma show you how to turn it up a notch

 (Pool full of Kendrick's lies in it)
 Aw man… where is she takin' me?
 Where is she takin' me?
 (Pool full of liquor ima die in it)
 All I, All I, All I, All I have in life is my new appetite for failure
 And I got hunger pain that grow insane
 Tell me, do that sound familiar?
 If it do, then you're like me
 Makin' excuse that your relief
 Is in the bottom of the bottle and the greenest indo leaf
 As the window open I release
 Everything that corrode inside of me
 I see you jokin', why you laugh?
 Don't you feel bad? I probably sleep
 And never ever wake up, never ever wake up, never ever wake up
 In God I trust, but just when I thought I had enough
 They stomped the homie out over a bitch?
 K-Dot, you good, blood?
 Now we can drop, ye we can drop you back off
 That nigga's straight, man, that nigga ain't trippin'
 We gon' do the same ol' shit
 I'ma pop a few shots, they gon' run, they gon' run opposite ways
 Fall right in *****'s lap
 And he gon' tear they ass up, simple as that
 And I hope that bitch that set him up out there
 We gon' pop that bitch too
 Wait hold up, ayy, I see somebody
 [Gunshots]
 Aha! Got them niggas, K-Dot, you good?
 L****, you good?

"Sing About Me, I'm Dying of Thirst","good kid, m.A.A.d city",A Short Film by Kendrick Lamar,10,12:03,,Studio,2,22 Oct 12,12,"When the lights shut off and it's my turn
 To settle down, my main concern
 Promise that you will sing about me
 Promise that you will sing about me
 I said when the lights shut off and it's my turn
 To settle down, my main concern
 Promise that you will sing about me
 Promise that you will sing about me
 I woke up this morning and figured I'd call you
 In case I'm not here tomorrow
 I'm hopin' that I can borrow
 A peace of mind, I'm behind on what's really important
 My mind is really distorted
 I find nothing but trouble in my life
 I'm fortunate you believe in a dream
 This orphanage we call a ghetto is quite a routine
 And last night was just another distraction
 Or a reaction of what we consider madness
 I know exactly what happened
 You ran outside when you heard my brother cry for help
 Held him like a newborn baby and made him feel
 Like everything was alright in a fight he tried to put up
 But the type of bullet that stuck
 Had went against his will, that's blood spilled on your hands
 My plan's rather vindictive
 Everybody's a victim in my eyes
 When I ride it's a murderous rhythm
 And outside became pitch black
 A demon glued to my back, whispering ""Get 'em!""
 I got 'em and I ain't give a fuck
 That same mentality I told my brother not to duck
 In actuality it's a trip how we trip off of colors
 I wonder if I'll ever discover a passion like you and recover
 The life that I knew as a youngin
 In pajamas and dun-ta-duns
 When thunder comes it rains cats and dogs dumb
 Niggas like me never prosper
 Prognosis of a problem child, I'm proud and well-devoted
 This Piru shit been in me forever
 So forever I'ma push it, wherever, whenever
 And I love you 'cause you love my brother like you did
 Just promise me you'll tell this story when you make it big
 And if I die before your album drop, I hope—
 [Gunshots]
 Promise that you will sing about me
 Promise that you will sing about me
 I said when the lights shut off and it's my turn
 To settle down, my main concern
 Promise that you will sing about me
 Promise that you will sing about me
 You wrote a song about my sister on your tape
 And called it Section.80
 The message resembled ""Brenda's Got a Baby""
 What's crazy was I was hearin' about it
 But doubted your ignorance
 How could you ever just put her on blast and shit?
 Judgin' her past and shit?
 Well, it's completely my future
 Her nigga behind me right now askin' for ass and shit
 And I'ma need that forty dollars
 Even if I got to fuck, suck and swallow
 In the parking lot, Gonzales Park, I'm followed
 By a married man, and father of three
 My titties bounce on the cadence of his tinklin' keys
 Matter of fact, he my favorite 'cause he tip me with E's
 He got a cousin named David and I seen him last week
 This is the life of another girl damaged by the system
 These foster homes, I run away and never do miss 'em
 See, my hormones just run away and if I can get 'em
 Back to where they used to be, then I'll probably be in the denim
 Of a family gene that show women how to be woman
 Or better yet, a leader, you need her to learn somethin'
 Then you probably need to beat her, that's how I was taught
 Three niggas in one room, first time I was tossed
 And I'm exhausted, but fuck that ""Sorry for your loss"" shit
 My sister died in vain, but what point are you tryna gain
 If you can't fit the pumps I walk in?
 I'll wait… Your rebuttal a little too late
 And if you have a album date, just make sure I'm not in the song
 'Cause I don't need the attention, bring enough of that on my own
 And matter fact, did I mention that I physically feel great?
 A doctor's approval is a waste of time, I know I'm straight
 I'll probably live longer than you and never fade away
 I'll never fade away, I'll never fade away, I know my fate
 And I'm on the grind for this cake, I'ma get it or die tryin'
 I'm eyein' every male gender with intentions of buyin'
 You lyin' to these motherfuckers
 Talkin' about you can help 'em with my story
 You can help me if you sell this pussy for me, nigga
 Don't ignore me, nigga, fuck your glory, nigga, you ain't shit...
 When the lights shut off and it's my turn
 To settle down, my main concern
 Promise that you will sing about me
 Promise that you will sing about me
 I said when the lights shut off and it's my turn
 To settle down, my main concern
 Promise that you will sing about me
 Promise that you will sing about me
 Sometimes I look in the mirror
 And ask myself: Am I really scared of passin' away?
 If it's today, I hope I hear a
 Cry out from Heaven so loud it can water down a demon
 With the Holy Ghost 'til it drown in the blood of Jesus
 I wrote some raps that made sure that my lifeline reekin'
 The scent of a reaper, ensurin' that my allegiance
 With the other side may come soon, and if I'm doomed
 May the womb of my mother be blessed for many moons
 I suffer a lot
 And every day that glass mirror get tougher to watch
 I tie my stomach in knots
 And I'm not sure why I'm infatuated with death
 My imagination is surely an aggravation of threats
 That can come about, ’cause the tongue is mighty powerful
 And I can name a list of your favorites that probably vouch
 Maybe 'cause I'm a dreamer and sleep is the cousin of death
 Really stuck in the schema of wonderin' when I'ma rest
 And you're right, your brother was a brother to me
 And your sister's situation was the one that pulled me
 In a direction to speak on somethin'
 That's realer than the TV screen
 By any means, wasn't tryin' to offend or come between
 Her personal life, I was like ""It need to be told""
 Cursin' the life of twenty generations after her soul
 Exactly what'd happen if I ain't continue rappin'
 Or steady bein' distracted by money, drugs and 4-5's
 I count lives, all on these songs
 Look at the weak and cry, pray one day you'll be strong
 Fightin' for your rights, even when you're wrong
 And hope that at least one of you sing about me when I'm gone
 Am I worth it? Did I put enough work in?
 Promise that you will sing about me
 Promise that you will sing about me
 I said when the lights shut off and it's my turn
 To settle down, my main concern
 Promise that you will sing about me
 Promise that you will sing about me
 Promise that you'll sing about me forever
 Promise that you'll sing about me for— ooooh
 Promise that you'll sing about me forever
 Promise that you'll sing about me for— ooooh
 Promise that you'll sing about me forever
 Promise that you'll sing about me for— ooooh
 Promise that you'll sing about me forever
 Promise that you'll sing about me for— ooooh
 ""Ay, ay, ay, where you 'bout to go?""
 ""Nigga, the homie's brother—nigga, right here, he gone, my nigga, he gone!""
 ""Hey, come to the store for a nigga, one time.""
 ""We on the block right now, my nigga, like, we—nigga, we right here, my nigga.""
 ""Bring a nigga back a black!""
 ""Nigga—bruh—nigga, they just killed the homie's brother, my nigga. We right here on the block, my nigga...
 Al—alright, nigga—nigga, just come—alright, alright, just call me back, man, just call me back.""
 ""Bring a nigga back a black!""
 ""Ahh, fuck... So, so, what we gon' do, my niggas? What we gon' do?""
 ""Bro, we can go back right now, my nigga. Like... nigga, I don't give a fuck, my nigga. We can go back right now.""
 ""Fuck! I'm tired of this shit! I'm tired of fuckin' runnin', I'm tired of this shit! My brother, homie!""
 Tired of runnin', tired of huntin'
 My own kind, but retirin' nothin'
 Tires are steady screechin', the driver is rubbin'
 Hands on the wheel, who said we wasn't
 Dying of thirst, dying of thirst, dying of thirst?
 Dope on the corner, look at the coroner
 Daughter is dead, mother is mournin' her
 Stray bullets, AK bullets
 Resuscitation was waitin' patiently, but they couldn't
 Bring her back, who got the footage?
 Channel 9, cameras is lookin'
 It's hard to channel your energy when you know he crooked
 Banana clip, split his banana pudding
 I'm like Tre, that's Cuba Gooding
 I know I'm good at
 Dying of thirst, dying of thirst, dying of thirst
 How many sins? I'm runnin' out
 How many sins? I lost count
 Dreams of ballin' like Spalding
 But only shotty bounce
 The reaper callin', I'm cottonmouth
 Money is power (Money is power)
 Yours is ours (Yours is ours)
 Lay with a snitch, die with a coward
 Hope we get rich, hope we can tower
 Over the city with vanity with the music louder
 The same song, a black flower
 I'll show you how to
 Dye your thirst, dye your thirst, dye your thirst
 What are we doin'? Who are we foolin'?
 Hell is hot, fire is proven
 To burn for eternity, return of the student
 That never learned how to live righteous but how to shoot it
 Tired of runnin', choirs is hummin'
 Tell us to visit, we lie about comin'
 Now back to business, loadin' the guns in
 Back of the Buick, your hood is feudin'
 The beef is bubblin', it's no discussion
 Hereditary, all of my cousins
 Dying of thirst, dying of thirst, dying of thirst
 Too many sins, I'm runnin' out
 Somebody send me a well for the drought
 See all I know is takin' notes
 On takin' this life for granted, granted, if he provoke
 My best days, I stress days
 (Lord, forgive me for all my sins, for I not know—)
 My best days, I stress days
 Say ""fuck the world,"" my sex slave
 Money, pussy, and greed—what's my next crave?
 Whatever it is, know it's my next grave
 Tired of runnin', tired of runnin', tired of tumblin'
 Tired of runnin', tired of tumblin' – backwards
 My momma say ""See, a pastor give me a promise
 What if today was the rapture and you completely tarnished?
 The truth will set you free, so to me be completely honest
 You dying of thirst, you dying of thirst
 So hop in that water, and pray that it works.""
 Fuck! I’m tired of this shit!
 I’m tired of fuckin' runnin', I’m tired of this shit!
 That’s my brother, homie!
 Young man, come talk to me! Is that what I think that is?
 I know that's not what I think that is
 Why are you so angry?
 See, you young men are dying of thirst
 Do you know what that means?
 That means you need water, holy water
 You need to be baptized, with the spirit of the Lord
 Do you want to receive God as your personal savior?
 Okay, repeat after me:
 ""Lord God, I come to You a sinner.""
 (Lord God, I come to You a sinner)
 ""And I humbly repent for my sins.""
 (And I humbly repent for my sins)
 ""I believe that Jesus is Lord.""
 (I believe that Jesus is Lord)
 ""I believe you raised Him from the dead.""
 (I believe you raised Him from the dead)
 ""I would ask that Jesus come into my life.""
 (I would ask that Jesus come in my life)
 ""And be my Lord and Savior.""
 (And be my Lord and Savior)
 ""I receive Jesus to take control of my life.""
 (I receive Jesus to take control of my life)
 ""And that I may live for Him from this day forward.""
 (And that I may live for Him from this day forward)
 ""Thank you, Lord Jesus
 For saving me with Your precious blood.""
 (Thank you, Lord Jesus
 For saving me with Your precious blood)
 ""In Jesus' name, amen.""
 (In Jesus' name, amen)

Real,"good kid, m.A.A.d city",A Short Film by Kendrick Lamar,11,7:23,Anna Wise,Studio,2,22 Oct 12,12,"I do what I wanna do
 I say what I wanna say, when I feel, and I
 Look in the mirror and know I'm there
 With my hands in the air, I'm proud to say yeah
 I'm real, I'm real, I'm really, really, real
 I'm real, I'm real, I'm really, really, real
 I'm real, I'm real, I'm really, really, real
 I'm real, I'm real, I'm really, really, real
 I promise that I know you very well
 Your eyes never lie, even if they tell
 Sweet lullabies that come with a smell
 Of a dozen roses flipping down the green hill
 You're living in a world that come with plan B
 Cause plan A never relay a guarantee
 And plan C never could say just what it was
 And your plans only can pan around love
 You love him, you love them, you love her
 You love so much, you love when love hurts
 You love red bottom and gold that say ""Queen""
 You love hand-bag on the waist of your jean
 You love French tip and trip that pay for
 You love bank slip that tell you we paid more
 You love a good hand whenever the card dealt
 But what love got to do with it when you don't love yourself?
 I do what I wanna do
 I say what I wanna say, when I feel, and I
 Look in the mirror and know I'm there
 With my hands in the air, I'm proud to say yeah
 I'm real, I'm real, I'm really, really, real
 I'm real, I'm real, I'm really, really, real
 I'm real, I'm real, I'm really, really, real
 I'm real, I'm real, ('Cause before you know it, everything's gone)
 I promise that I know you very well
 Your eyes never lie, even if they fell
 Out the sky and your optics turn stale
 Where they mold that's green, I can see you fit the bill
 Of living in a world that come with plan B
 Cause plan A only can make another mistake
 And you can't see success coming from plan C
 When it all breaks, you'll still say you're lovely
 And love them and love when you love her
 You love so much, you love when love hurts
 You love fast cars and dead presidents old
 You love fast women, you love keepin' control
 Of everything that you love, you love beef
 You love streets, you love running, ducking police
 You love your hood, might even love it to death
 But what love got to do with it when you don't love yourself?
 I do what I wanna do
 I say what I wanna say, when I feel, and I
 Look in the mirror and know I'm there
 With my hands in the air, I'm proud to say yeah
 I'm real, I'm real, I'm really, really, real
 I'm real, I'm real, I'm really, really, real
 I'm real, I'm real, I'm really, really, real
 I'm real, I'm real ('Cause before you know it, everything's gone)
 The reason why I know you very well
 Cause we have the same eyes, can't you tell?
 The days I tried to cover up and conceal
 My pride, it only made it harder for me to deal
 When living in a world that come with plan B
 A scapegoat cause plan A don't come free
 And plan C just an excuse like ""because""
 Or the word ""but,"" but what if I got love?
 I love them, I love when I love her
 I love so much, I love when love hurts
 I love first verse ’cause you're the girl I attract
 I love second verse ’cause you're the homie that pack
 Burner like a stove top, that love cooking from scratch
 I love what the both of you have to offer
 In fact, I love it so much, I don't love anything else
 But what love got to do with it when I don't love myself
 To the point I should hate everything I do love?
 Should I hate living my life inside the club?
 Should I hate her for watching me for that reason?
 Should I hate him for telling me that I'm seizin'?
 Should I hate them for telling me ""ball out""?
 Should I hate street credibility I'm talkin' about
 Hating all money, power, respect in my will
 Or hating the fact none of that shit make me real?
 Kenny, I ain't trippin' off them dominoes anymore.
 Just calling, sorry to hear what happened to your homeboy, but don't learn the hard way like I did, homie.
 Any nigga can kill a man, that don't make you a real nigga.
 Real is responsibility. Real is taking care of your motherfucking family. Real is God, nigga.
 I do what I wanna do
 I say what I wanna say, when I feel, and I
 Look in the mirror and know I'm there
 With my hands in the air, I'm proud to say yeah
 I'm real, I'm real, I'm really, really, real
 I'm real, I'm real, I'm really, really, real
 I'm real, I'm real, I'm really, really, real
 I'm real, I'm real (cause before you know it, everything's gone)
 Alright, that's all I wanted to tell you.
 Just make sure you call us back when you get this message. Here go your mom.
 Boy, you better have my car on full all this time you done had my damn car, but look I ain't trippin'.
 Look, the neighbors say they seen you and your little friends over there by Food-4-Less
 and they was preaching to you over there telling you about the good book because right about now that's what y'all need.
 Oh, and Top Dawg called the house too. I guess they want you and Dave to come to the studio.
 But look, you take that music business serious, and put out something me and your dad can step to.
 Shit, you know we from Chicago, you know that's what we do.
 Sing my song, it's all for you
 Sing my song, it's all for you
 Sing my song, it's all for you
 Sing my song, it's all for you
 Sing my song, it's all for you
 Sing my song, it's all for you
 Sing my song, it's all for you
 Sing my song, it's all for you
 Sing my song, it's all for you
 Sing my song, it's all for you
 Sing my song, it's all for you
 Sing my song, it's all for you
 Sing my song, it's all for you
 Sing my song, it's all for you
 Sing my song, it's all for you
 Sing my song, it's all for you
 If I don't hear from you by tomorrow, I hope you come back and learn from your mistakes.
 Come back a man, tell your story to these black and brown kids in Compton.
 Let 'em know you was just like them, but you still rose from that dark place of violence, becoming a positive person.
 But when you do make it, give back with your words of encouragement, and that's the best way to give back.
 To your city... And I love you Kendrick, if I don't hear you knocking on the door you know where I usually leave the key.

Compton,"good kid, m.A.A.d city",A Short Film by Kendrick Lamar,12,4:08,Dr. Dre,Studio,2,22 Oct 12,12,"Now everybody serenade the new faith of Kendrick Lamar
 This is King Kendrick Lamar
 King Kendrick and I meant it, my point intended is raw
 Fix your lenses forensics would've told you Kendrick had killed it
 Pretend it's a massacre and the masses upon us
 And I mastered being the master at dodging your honor
 And the chapter that read at twenty-five I would live dormant like five in the morning
 They raid your spot while Kendrick's performing
 And if they take everything, know I got
 Compton, Compton
 Ain't no city quite like mine
 Ay, Dre what's happening wit' it, my nigga?
 Still I'm at it, peel the plastic off it, you can feel the magic
 Still I'm laughing at the critics talking, I can see 'em gagging
 When I'm back in the back of my city, back in the 'bach
 With a batch of them banging Dre Beats with me, look where I'm at
 It's the murder cap' and I'm captain at birthing this gangsta rap
 It's a wrap when I'm done and I come a long way from a hundred dollars a month
 To a hundred mil' in a day, bitch I'm from
 Compton, Compton
 Ain't no city quite like mine
 So come and visit the tire screeching, ambulance, policeman
 Won't you spend a weekend on Rosecrans, nigga?
 Khaki creasing, crime increasing on Rosecrans, nigga
 Kendrick Conan, nigga
 Where you sword at, hand on the cross and swore that
 I do it big as Rasputia for them shooters
 Kama Sutra scream fuck your position and make you hold that
 I'm trying to stay grounded like four flats
 But I know flats and Piru Crip tats
 Will swarm on me like a beehive
 Hop in the G ride
 From the West to the Eastside
 Know that's just how Compton roll
 And that's a given
 I pass the blunt then pass the torch of course that's my decision
 I crash the Porsche then you report that you see me in Benzes
 I must report that we import the narcotics you bought it
 Then talked about it when crack hit the speakers, the music business
 I blow up every time we throw up a record
 Depending on what you expecting, I'm sure it's bigger than your religion
 Perfected by niggas that manifested music to live in
 Compton, Compton
 Ain't no city quite like mine
 So tell that gangster throw his set high
 Roll it up in a blunt, I'mma take you on the next high
 I did exactly what I wanted that's what made them checks fly
 In my direction, you never questioned when I said I
 Would be a mogul before I visit 2Pac and Left-Eye
 Eazy and Aaliyah when I see you we gon' test drive
 A Lambo in heaven but for now I'm on the redeye
 Flying back to my city cuz I'll forever standby
 Compton, Compton
 Ain't no city quite like mine
 Now we can all celebrate
 We can all harvest the rap artists of N.W.A.
 America target our rap market, as controversy and hate
 Harsh realities we in made our music translate
 To the coke dealers, the hood rich
 And the broke niggas that play
 With them gorillas that know killers
 That know where you stay
 Roll that kush, crack that case, ten bottles of rosé
 This was brought to you by Dre
 Now every motherfucker in here say:
 ""Look who's responsible
 For taking Compton international
 I make 'em holla""
 Ayo Just Blaze, good looking homie
 Just Blaze
 Ain't no city quite like mine, yeah
 In the city of Compton

The Recipe,"good kid, m.A.A.d city (Deluxe)",A Short Film by Kendrick Lamar,13,5:52,Dr. Dre,Studio (Reissue),2,,,"(Smokin' weed with you
 'Cause you’ve taught me to
 Smokin' weed with you
 'Cause you’ve taught me to)
 Every morning when I wake up, uh
 Money on my mind, good time to get caked up, uh
 Sunshine coming through my blinds, I’m living, but
 Really though, it's never enough, ten million, that's a must
 Living in California, everybody wanna visit for
 Women, weed and weather
 They come for women, weed and weather
 For the women, weed and weather
 From all around the world for the women, weed and weather
 These niggas'll kill for that, put it in your grill for that
 Still everybody gotta build for that, me? I make mills off that
 How the fuck y'all can't see I ride, when I drive
 Down the block and you look outside
 H-A-T-E in your eyes, I enter big money for the enterprise
 It's a beautiful day, I guess, for a bitch to roll with Andre, I guess
 Roll it up, baby, come and lift that dress
 Then roll it up for me when I'm stressed
 You might catch me in Atlanta looking like a boss
 New Orleans and then Miami, party in New York
 Texas, I be screwed up, Chi-Town, I be really pimpin'
 But nothing like my hometown, I'm forever livin'
 Women, weed and weather
 They come for women, weed and weather
 For the women, weed and weather
 From all around the world for the women, weed and weather
 Got that women, weed and weather
 Don't it sound clever? Come and play
 Wh-what more can I say? W-welcome to LA
 Uhh, my nigga said he wanna fly out to get him some
 Three W's only for a three-day run, bitch
 Take them mothafuckin' panties off, you ain't no nun, shit
 I be living in the sky every time I ride by them hoes
 ""Ribbon In The Sky"" on the radio 'cause Stevie know I control
 Let it breathe, I control, California living 'til I am old
 You want to be on to peak on the charts
 So the peons can be gone and pee on their hearts
 She in the coupe, she in the Neon
 'Cause she on the BS before we can start
 Fuck with a nigga, ride with a nigga
 Let 'em know I'm priority, order me
 Hennessy and, for my niggas, OG Killa
 Call it Jason Voorhees, boy, he's on his job
 Boy, he sure be having the marks on they mark
 Pretty bitches and tire marks, let 'em inhale them pipe exhausts
 Let 'em reveal how much it cost for this life, controlling my price?
 No way, hell no, uh-uh
 If I'm wrong, I don't wanna be right
 We want to be on to peak on the charts
 So the peons can be gone and pee on their hearts
 Women, weed, weather, it's not my fault
 That it's 82 degrees and my top peeled off
 You might catch me in Atlanta looking like a boss
 New Orleans and then Miami, party in New York
 Texas, I be screwed up, Chi-Town, I be really pimpin'
 But nothing like my hometown, I'm forever livin'
 Women, weed and weather
 They come for women, weed and weather
 For the women, weed and weather
 From all around the world for the women, weed and weather
 Got that women, weed and weather
 Don't it sound clever? Come and play
 Wh-what more can I say? W-welcome to LA
 Known for that homegrown where I come from
 Smoke one, palm trees, double D's got 'em topless in the sun
 I shall proceed, that's me, mothafuck your opinion
 Huh, how many ways am I killing 'em? Shit, right around a billion
 We on it, that mean we living for the moment
 That mean she'll fuck 'til the morning, time and I got time
 And I know that I'm in a position of controlling
 Anything out by that ocean
 I'm a boss, I'll buy that ocean, ain't nobody fucking with this
 They want that shit, they often fiend
 I give it to 'em, but in between
 My time, I gotta tie shoestrings
 Life's a trip when you want these things
 I often slip and then I lean
 Toward three W's in life
 You know blow job need an application
 Eating pussy make appetite
 And yeah, my type, I like 'em brown
 Just like my drink, the fuck you think?
 I don't fuck with no hand-me-downs
 See if you fuck, then it's after me
 You know how much I'ma make it work?
 You know her dress livin' in her purse
 When you discuss your love for lust
 Just make sure you visit here first: Cali
 You might catch me in Atlanta looking like a boss
 New Orleans and then Miami, party in New York
 Texas, I be screwed up, Chi-Town, I be really pimpin'
 But nothing like my hometown, I'm forever livin'
 Women, weed and weather
 They come for women, weed and weather
 For the women, weed and weather
 From all around the world for the women, weed and weather
 Got that women, weed and weather
 Don't it sound clever? Come and play
 Wh-what more can I say? W-welcome to LA

Black Boy Fly,"good kid, m.A.A.d city (Deluxe)",A Short Film by Kendrick Lamar,14,4:38,,Studio (Reissue),2,,,"So I'm saying, ""What up? What up? Nigga, you made it""
 So I'm saying, ""What up? What up? Nigga, you made it""
 So I'm saying, ""What up? What up? Nigga, you made it""
 So I'm saying, ""What up? What up? Nigga, I hate it""
 So I'm saying, ""What up? What up? Nigga, I hate it""
 Frustrated and I'm riding down them back streets
 Making my conscience ask me
 ""Will I survive to make it up out this hole in time?""
 Black boy fly, black boy fly
 Black, black boy fly, black boy fly
 I used to be jealous of Arron Afflalo
 I used to be jealous of Arron Afflalo
 He was the one to follow
 He was the only leader foreseeing brighter tomorrows
 He would live in the gym, we was living in sorrow
 Total envy of him, he made his dream become a reality
 Actually making it possible to swim
 His way up outta Compton with further more to accomplish
 Graduate with honors, a sponsor of basketball scholars
 It's 2004 and I'm watching him score thirty
 Remember vividly how them victory points had hurt me
 'Cause every basket was a reaction or a reminder
 That we was just moving backwards
 The bungalow where you find us
 The art of us ditching classes, heading nowhere fast
 Stick my head inside the study hall, he focused on math
 Determination ambition, plus dedication and wisdom
 Qualities he was given was the shit we didn't have
 Dug inside of his book bag and Coach Palmer asked for his finals
 He had his back like a spinal, meanwhile
 We singing the same old song spinning the vinyl
 Eleven graders gone wrong
 He focused on the NBA, we focused on some Patron
 Now watch that black boy fly
 Black boy fly, watch that black boy fly
 Black boy fly, watch that black boy fly
 Black boy fly, watch that black boy fly
 Black boy
 I used to be jealous of Jayceon
 I used to be jealous of Jayceon Taylor when I was young
 Taylor made a career out of music from writing songs
 A Buick had driven past bumping him when I mowed the lawn
 Money laundering hustling, homies pondering up against
 Schemes to make a million even if doing you harm
 War's the case and just in case you wasn't alarmed
 The city had fought with firearms and many had died before dawn
 It's 2004 and I'm hearing the people roar
 For the name of The Game, they line in front of the store
 Swap meets, selling our mixtapes, I'm like, ""Oh shit, wait""
 Don't wanna be another nigga stuck regretting mistakes
 Mixed feelings was my opinion, I was defending my insecurities
 Chillin' my conscience next to a villain
 Compton made you believe success wasn't real
 Be honest, none of us knew of a record deal
 So as I peel through these lottery tickets
 I see a Harley Davidson truck visit the same plaza we shopped
 A tall nigga hopped out with Jordans and a white tank top
 He was top of the rap game, we was the top of the block
 So watch that black boy fly
 Black boy fly, watch that black boy fly
 Black boy fly, watch that black boy fly
 Black boy fly, watch that black boy fly
 Black boy
 My mama didn't raise me up to be jealous-hearted
 Like most of the winners call it
 Regardless of where you stay, hold your head and continue marching
 That's what she said, but in my head I wanted to be like Jordan
 Award touring the country with money from mic recording
 The only way out the ghetto, you know the stereotype
 Shooting hoops or live on the stereo like Top 40
 And shortly, I got discouraged
 Like every time I walked to the corner, had them guns bursting
 Nigga, I was rehearsing in repetition the phrase
 That only one in a million will ever see better days
 Especially when the crime waves was bigger than tsunamis
 Break your boogie boards to pieces, you just a typical homie
 All these niggas facetious and they all standing beside me
 They all'll buy me a chopper if any one of you try me
 What am I to do when every neighborhood is an obstacle?
 When two niggas making it out had never sounded logical?
 Three niggas making it out? That's mission impossible
 So I never believed the type of performance that I could do
 I wasn't jealous cause of the talents they got
 I was terrified they'd be the last black boys to fly out of Compton
 Thank God

 A'ight
 1,2,3, go!
 Waking up in a dream
 Sleepwalking on another big stage
 You never heard peace 'til you hear people scream
 Your name in unison, I'm so far away
 From the place I used to be, struggling usually
 Look at the newer me, fate pursuing me
 I can feel the energy in the air
 It feel like I'm supposed to be here
 Everywhere I go I'm getting so much love
 Fans, the stars, everyone
 Sayin' how they can't wait for the LP
 And I'm gonna blow
 They believe in me
 Feel so good in what you do
 Helps somebody else get through
 That's why I do the best I can
 Because I know how blessed I am
 I'm so high I can touch the sky
 I know it's my time
 And it's now or never
 I shine so bright I light the night
 And it feels so right, ain't nothing better
 A fool if I take it all for granted
 A smart man if I keep my feet planted
 To the earth 'cause the people that hurt can understand it
 You speakin' outlandish
 I'mma show you how to make it all work
 Another planet, it's a short term goal for me
 A record sold for me
 It's just more of me in your ear
 For you to hear Kendrick persevere
 Defenses I feel relentless
 Ambition with a clear vision
 Takin' off I ain't takin off these Pistons
 I'm takin' off on the inner me - you're distance
 Came across me, how much it'a cost me
 To get you out my business
 I said a planet is a short term goal, no sky is the limit
 I'm past that, now pass that
 Award, not one but four
 Times two plus yours
 I see myself performing there, (K-Dot)
 Sold out shows where the room is packed
 Sitting at the Grammy's winning five awards
 See myself on big billboards
 Traveling around the world with endorsement deals
 Can't imagine how it feels
 That's why I'm smiling everyday
 Because my dream ain't far away
 I'm so high I can touch the sky
 I know it's my time
 And it's now or never
 I shine so bright I light the night
 And it feels so right, ain't nothing better
 You looking at me and you tell me I'm blessed
 Calculated my steps, my heart, my breath
 Breathe in lungs of a victory and vividly
 You see me when at my best, my worst
 This verse dedicated to the days that I slept
 With a curse research my paid dues I'm reimbursed
 I burst in the crowd with a voice and a crown
 I'm a King on the prowl and I see mama smile?
 And I vow on the tape that I'll never break
 You can break bread with me now
 We can all take a bow on the edge of the pedestal
 Then scream out loud that we made it off the avenue
 And walked that mile
 In the darkness I often sit back
 And get lost in the rap that I wrote
 When you told me that it spoke to your soul
 I was talking to you
 I was walking it through every ghetto
 Tell success hello
 We here
 And I'm so happy I cry
 Cause I can't believe
 All the things I ever wanted
 Are finally happening for me
 And it's so surreal
 That I almost feel
 That any minute I can wake up
 From this fantasy
 When you pray so hard
 And you've come so far
 And you know that it's the time for you to lift your bar
 And I'm gonna do it
 Watch me!
 I'm so high I can touch the sky
 I know it's my time
 And it's now or never
 I shine so bright I light the night
 And it feels so right, ain't nothing better
 I'm so high I can touch the sky
 I know it's my time
 And it's now or never
 I shine so bright I light the night

 Mama take this mothafuckin' block off
 Tryna reach you every day, collect calls
 Never get through, and I go through withdrawals
 Say who told you that I wanted this door
 To slam shut, I just wanted to vent or
 Ask you if you give me your rent for
 A attorney, I can pay you back more
 Soon as I get out, yeah, every rack is yours
 Commissary running low, I need help
 Not too much, I hustle up the rest myself
 K-Dot wrote me saying Marcus got killed
 If you knew me, then you know how bad I feel
 Quisha prove me wrong, and never came to visit
 And I heard she fucking on some other nigga
 And my niggas left me in the dark, blind
 Mama just get back at me this last time

 Mama, take this mothafuckin' block off
 That's on the date the day I take the block off
 Pulled up, and they put me in them cop cars
 Please believe me, this ain't easy by far
 You forgot you're talking to your only son
 'Member when you put me in that relay run
 I was racing, chasing dreams to be the best
 You had taught me that the very day I won
 All I need is you to give me same support
 Investigation saying that the same report
 From a witness just might testify in court
 DA say I take a deal, or take a loss
 I ain't built for all them goddamn numbers
 God's will, say a prayer for me mama
 If you can't, then open up the phone lines
 Mama just get back at me this last time

 Men lie, wo—women

 Look at all the bullshit I been through
 If I take you home, will you tell the truth?
 Dante, if I stress to take the block off
 That's the day the state had take them locks off
 I could only help but do so much
 Bettering yourself, your own crutch
 Look at your reflection, tell me who you see
 Who is your protection? G-O-D
 No, it's not neglection, I have just accepted
 Your fate and what its gon' be
 'Member all the nights that I cried
 Thinkin' that my only son just died
 Peeking through the window, kickin' through the door
 It's you they looking for, raid outside
 Rather see you locked up than dead
 Only you would say that I'm selfish
 So before I take the stand and put this bible in my hand
 Son, let me say this

 I’ve been waiting on this day since Dr. Dre and Pac
 Was on Rosecrans in that burger stand at '95
 People staring at 'em in amazement
 Reservations at the Days Inn
 We was living out a hotel at the time
 Breakfast, lunch and dinner, chicken from Kentucky Fried
 Mama babysitting Section 8 vouchers the move
 When nothing else to lose but a burger flipping job
 Close my eyes inside the swap meet and imagine it's a mansion
 Gold ballroom, AK-47 dancin'
 Howling at the moon, what’s a pack of hungry babies?
 Hope you feed us soon, bite your back, you die of rabies
 Everyday we pray to eat at the table at Sizzlers
 But never make the visit, if better days was on its way
 Then they make the decision, to make the wrong turn
 So for now we heat this skillet so this canned food can burn
 Oh yeah, I remember that, it- it was the ravioli with the hot sauce in it, right?
 When we grow up we gon' go and get us a million
 Am I right?
 Spend it all in front of the county building
 Oh!
 Blow it like Coltrane, blow it like Coltrane, yeah
 Don't forget to sing along by the way, sing along
 When we grow up we gon' go and get us a million
 Spend it all in front of the county building
 Blow it like Coltrane, blow it like Coltrane, yeah
 And all the ghetto children in the world say, “that’s my car” (Aye, oh)
 All the ghetto boys say, “that’s my car” (Aye, oh)
 All the ghetto girls say, “that’s my car” (Aye, oh)
 When we grow up, when we grow up (Aye, oh)
 Ghetto children in the world say, “that’s my car” (Aye, oh)
 All the ghetto boys say, “that’s my car” (Aye, oh)
 All the ghetto girls say, “that’s my car” (Aye, oh)
 When we grow up, when we grow up (Aye, oh)
 Nigga you remember the smoke and the burning buildings and shit?
 Couple stolen TVs and a seat belt for my safety (Uh-huh)
 Played the passenger I think it’s five years after eighty (Yeah, yeah that)
 Seven, do the math, '92, don’t you be lazy (I won't)
 Looking out the window, notice all the essentials
 Of a block party that stop for a second, then it rekindle
 Like a flame from a trick candle, everybody got dental
 Insurance ‘cause we ‘bout to floss, you get that couch I sent you?
 I heard that from a block away, probably had credentials
 Of a scholar but, shit, not today, them Dayton Spokes was his to take
 Refrigerators, barbecue pits, and Jordan kicks
 They did invasions while helicopters recorded it
 Hello Mi-Mister Miyagi, I want them Kenwood woofers
 Say that you got me, if not, I’ll dig in your drawer for it
 The swap meet was the bulls' eye like Tauruses
 Murder was the melody you should know what the chorus is
 ""Papa, you really telling me we can just get some more of it
 If we run out?"" He said, ""Lil' nigga, today the poor is rich
 Don’t tell your mom that you seen a Molotov bomb
 If she ask just know you have to lie and son don’t forget
 Bitches ain’t shit, hoes ain’t neither
 Niggas gon' snitch, watch the company you keeping
 And one day you’ll put money in the ghetto when you got it
 Rather than having to hustle off these Rodney King riots""
 That- that’s right the mothafuckin’ Rodney King...
 You was with your daddy on Bullis Road
 When we grow up we gon' go and get us a million
 That's crazy
 Spend it all in front of the county building
 Blow it like Coltrane, blow it like Coltrane
 Don't forget, still sing along kids, still sing along
 When we grow up we gon' go and get us a million
 Please sing
 Spend it all in front of the county building
 Blow it like Coltrane, blow it like Coltrane",,,,,,,2012,"TDE Red Room, Carson, California, USA",DJ Khalil,"Derek ""MixedByAli"" Ali","Dr. Dre;Derek ""MixedByAli"" Ali","Mike Bozzi;Brian ""Big Bass"" Gardner",Kendrick Duckworth;Dontae Winslow;Khalil Abdul-Rahman,,,,,Punch;Dave Free;Larry Chatman;Andrew Van Meter;Ashley Palmer,Kendrick Lamar,"Terrence ""Punch"" Henderson;Dave Free;Kirdis Postelle","Derek ""MixedByAli"" Ali;Dee Brown;Mike Larson;James Hunt;Mauricio Iragorri;Jared Scott","Anthony ""Top Dawg"" Tiffith;Dr. Dre",Punch;Dave Free;Moosa,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Kendrick Lamar,,http://www.kendricklamar.com/sites/g/files/aaj321/f/styles/suzuki_breakpoints_image_mobile-lg/public/release/202103/ab67616d0000b2737468467632649e2f7903d096.jpg?itok=BA5Fa7Bb,"Invisible Creature, Inc.ScHoolboy Q;Kendrick Lamar",Dan Monick;Paula Oliver;Dwane LaFleur,,https://soundcloud.com/kendricklamarcompton/sets/good-kid-m-a-a-d-city-kendrick,,,,"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Good_Kid,_M.A.A.D_City",https://www.allmusic.com/album/good-kid-maad-city-mw0002421248/credits,,258,4.3,0.07,,,,,,,,,,2,,,,,,1,,,,1,,,,,,,,,,,,2,,2,,,,,,,,,1,,2,,,,,2,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,X,X,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,2,2,,,,,1,,,,,2,,1,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1,,,,,1,,1,,,,,1,,1,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Wesley's Theory,To Pimp a Butterfly,A Blank Letter by Kendrick Lamar,1,4:47,George Clinton;Thundercat,Studio,3,15 Mar 15,16,"Every nigga is a star, ayy, every nigga is a star
 Every nigga is a star, ayy, every nigga is a star
 Every nigga is a star, ayy
 Who will deny that you and I and every nigga is a star?
 Hit me!
 When the four corners of this cocoon collide
 You’ll slip through the cracks hopin' that you’ll survive
 Gather your wit, take a deep look inside
 Are you really who they idolize?
 To pimp a butterfly
 At first, I did love you
 But now I just wanna fuck
 Late nights thinkin' of you
 Until I get my nut
 Tossed and turned, lesson learned
 You was my first girlfriend
 Bridges burned, all across the board
 Destroyed, but what for?
 When I get signed, homie, I'ma act a fool
 Hit the dance floor, strobe lights in the room
 Snatch your little secretary bitch for the homies
 Blue-eyed devil with a fat-ass monkey
 I'ma buy a brand new Caddy on vogues
 Chunk the hood up, two times, deuce-four
 Platinum on everythin', platinum on weddin' ring
 Married to the game and a bad bitch chose
 When I get signed, homie, I'ma buy a strap
 Straight from the CIA, set it on my lap
 Take a few M-16s to the hood
 Pass 'em all out on the block, what's good?
 I'ma put the Compton swap meet by the White House
 Republican run up, get socked out
 Hit the press with a Cuban link on my neck
 Uneducated, but I got a million-dollar check like that
 We should never gave
 We should never gave niggas money
 Go back home, money, go back home
 We should never gave
 We should never gave niggas money
 Go back home, money, go back home
 (Everybody get out)
 At first, I did love you (Love you)
 But now I just wanna fuck (I just wanna fuck)
 Late nights thinkin' of you (Of you)
 Until I get my nut ('Til I get my nut)
 Tossed and turned, lesson learned
 You was my first girlfriend
 Bridges burned, all across the board (Across the board)
 Destroyed, but what for?
 Yo, what's up? It's Dre
 Remember the first time you came out to the house?
 You said you wanted a spot like mine
 But remember, anybody can get it
 The hard part is keepin' it, motherfucker
 What you want you? A house or a car?
 Forty acres and a mule, a piano, a guitar?
 Anythin', see, my name is Uncle Sam, I'm your dog
 Motherfucker, you can live at the mall
 I know your kind (That's why I'm kind)
 Don't have receipts (Oh, man, that's fine)
 Pay me later, wear those gators
 Cliché? Then say, ""Fuck your haters""
 I can see the baller in you, I can see the dollar in you
 Little white lies, but it's no white-collar in you
 But it's whatever though because I'm still followin' you
 Because you make me live forever, baby
 Count it all together, baby
 Then hit the register and make me feel better, baby
 Your horoscope is a gemini, two sides
 So you better cop everything two times
 Two coupes, two chains, two C-notes
 Too much ain't enough, both we know
 Christmas, tell 'em what's on your wish list
 Get it all, you deserve it, Kendrick
 And when you hit the White House, do you
 But remember, you ain't pass economics in school
 And everything you buy, taxes will deny
 I'll Wesley Snipe your ass before thirty-five
 Yeah, lookin' down, it's quite a drop (It's quite a drop, drop, drop)
 Lookin' good when you're on top (When you're on top, you got it)
 You got a medal for us
 Leavin' metaphors metaphysically in a state of euphoria
 Look both ways before you cross my mind
 We should never gave
 We should never gave niggas money
 Go back home, money, go back home
 We should never gave
 We should never gave niggas money
 Go back home, money, go back home
 Tax man comin', tax man comin'
 Tax man comin', tax man comin'

 I don't know why you trying to go big, nigga, you ain't shit
 Walking around like you God's gift to Earth, nigga, you ain't shit
 You ain't even buy me no outfit for the Fourth
 I need that Brazilian, wavy, twenty-eight inch, you playin'
 I shouldn't be fuckin' with you anyway
 I need a baller-ass, boss-ass nigga
 You's a off-brand-ass nigga, everybody know it
 Your homies know it, everybody fuckin' know
 Fuck you, nigga, don't call me no more
 You won't know, you gonna lose on a good bitch
 My other nigga is on, you off
 What the fuck is really going on?
 This dick ain't free
 You lookin' at me like it ain't a receipt
 Like I never made ends meet
 Eating your leftovers and raw meat
 This dick ain't free
 Livin' in captivity raised my cap salary
 Celery, tellin' me green is all I need
 Evidently all I seen was Spam and raw sardines
 This dick ain't free, I mean, baby
 You really think we could make a baby named Mercedes
 Without a Mercedes-Benz and twenty-four inch rims
 Five percent tint, and air conditioning vents?
 Hell fuckin' naw, this dick ain't free
 I need forty acres and a mule
 Not a forty ounce and a pit bull
 Bullshit, matador, matador
 Had the door knockin', let 'em in, who's that?
 Genital's best friend, this dick ain't free
 Pity the fool that made the pretty in you prosper
 Titty juice and pussy lips kept me obnoxious
 Kept me up watchin' pornos in poverty; apology? No
 Watch you politic with people less fortunate, like myself
 Every dog has its day, now doggy style shall help
 This dick ain't free
 Matter of fact, it need interest
 Matter of fact, it's nine inches
 Matter of fact, see our friendship based on business
 Pension, more pension, you're pinchin' my percents
 It's been relentless, fuck forgiveness, fuck your feelings
 Fuck your sources, all distortion, if you fuck it's more abortion
 More divorce courts and portion
 My check with less endorsement left me dormant
 Dusted, doomed, disgusted, forced with
 Fuck you think is in more shit?
 Porcelain pipes pressure, bust 'em twice

King Kunta,To Pimp a Butterfly,A Blank Letter by Kendrick Lamar,3,3:54,,Studio,3,15 Mar 15,16,"I got a bone to pick
 I don't want you monkey-mouth motherfuckers
 Sittin' in my throne again
 Ayy, ayy, nigga, what's happenin'?
 K-Dot back in the hood, nigga!
 I'm mad (He mad!), but I ain't stressin'
 True friends, one question
 Bitch, where you when I was walkin'?
 Now I run the game, got the whole world talkin'
 King Kunta, everybody wanna cut the legs off him
 Kunta, black man taking no losses, oh yeah
 Bitch, where you when I was walkin'?
 Now I run the game, got the whole world talkin'
 King Kunta, everybody wanna cut the legs off him
 When you got the yams—(What's the yams?)
 The yam is the power that be
 You can smell it when I'm walkin' down the street
 (Oh yes, we can, oh yes, we can)
 I can dig rappin', but a rapper with a ghostwriter?
 What the fuck happened? (Oh no!)
 I swore I wouldn't tell, but most of y'all sharing bars
 Like you got the bottom bunk in a two-man cell (A two-man cell)
 Something's in the water (Something's in the water)
 And if I gotta brown-nose for some gold
 Then I'd rather be a bum than a motherfuckin' baller (Oh yeah!)

 When you got the yams—(What's the yams?)
 The yam brought it out of Richard Pryor
 Manipulated Bill Clinton with desires
 Twenty-four-seven, three-sixty-five days times two
 I was contemplatin' gettin' off stage
 Just to go back to the hood, see my enemy, and say… (Oh yeah)
 Bitch, where you when I was walkin'?

 King Kunta, black man taking no losses, oh yeah
 Bitch, where you when I was walkin'?

 King Kunta, everybody wanna cut the legs off him
 You goat-mouth mammyfucker
 I was gonna kill a couple rappers, but they did it to themselves
 Everybody's suicidal, they ain't even need my help
 This shit is elementary, I'll probably go to jail
 If I shoot at your identity and bounce to the left
 Stuck a flag in my city, everybody's screamin', ""Compton!""
 I should probably run for mayor when I'm done, to be honest
 And I put that on my momma and my baby boo too
 Twenty million walkin' out the court buildin', woo-woo!
 Aw, yeah, fuck the judge
 I made it past twenty-five, and there I was
 A little nappy-headed nigga with the world behind him
 Life ain't shit but a fat vagina
 Screamin', ""Annie, are you okay? Annie, are you okay?""
 Limo tinted with the gold plates
 Straight from the bottom, this the belly of the beast
 From a peasant to a prince to a motherfuckin' king (Oh yeah)
 Bitch, where you when I was walkin'

 By the time you hear the next pop
 The funk shall be within you

 Now I run the game, got the whole world talkin'
 King Kunta, everybody wanna cut the legs off him

Institutionalized,To Pimp a Butterfly,A Blank Letter by Kendrick Lamar,4,4:31,Bilal;Anna Wise;Snoop Dawg,Studio,3,15 Mar 15,16,"What money got to do with it
 When I don't know the full definition of a rap image?
 I'm trapped inside the ghetto and I ain't proud to admit it
 Institutionalized, I keep runnin' back for a visit, hol' up
 Get it back
 I said I'm trapped inside the ghetto and I ain't proud to admit it
 Institutionalized, I could still kill me a nigga, so what?
 If I was the president
 I'd pay my mama's rent
 Free my homies and them
 Bulletproof my Chevy doors
 Lay in the White House and get high, Lord
 Whoever thought?
 Master, take the chains off me!
 Zoom, zoom, zoom, zoom, zoom
 Zoom, zoom, zoom
 Zoom, zoom, zoom, zoom, zoom
 Zoom, zoom, zoom
 Zoom, zoom, zoom, zoom, zoom
 Zoom, zoom, zoom
 Zoom, zoom, zoom, shit
 Life, to me, like a box of chocolate
 Quid pro quo, somethin' for somethin', that's the obvious
 Oh shit, flow's so sick, don't you swallow it
 Bitin' my style, you're salmonella poison positive
 I can just alleviate the rap industry politics
 Milk the game up, never lactose intolerant
 The last remainder of real shit, you know the obvious
 Me, scholarship? No, streets put me through colleges
 Be all you can be, true, but the problem is
 Dream only a dream if work don't follow it
 Remind me of the homies that used to know me, now follow this
 I'll tell you my hypothesis, I'm probably just way too loyal
 K-Dizzle will do it for you, my niggas think I'm a god
 Truthfully all of 'em spoiled, usually, you're never charged
 But somethin' came over you once I took you to them fuckin' BET Awards
 You lookin' at artistses like they're harvestses
 So many Rollies around you and you want all of 'em
 Somebody told me you thinkin' 'bout snatchin' jewelry
 I should've listened when my grandmama said to me:
 ""Shit don't change until you get up and wash yo' ass, nigga
 Shit don't change until you get up and wash yo' ass, boy
 Shit don't change until you get up and wash yo' ass, nigga
 Oh now, slow down""
 And once upon a time, in a city so divine
 Called West Side Compton, there stood a little nigga
 He was five-foot somethin', God bless the kid
 Took his homies to the show and this is what they said:
 ""Fuck am I 'posed to do when I'm lookin' at walkin' licks?
 The constant big money talk 'bout the mansion and foreign whips
 The private jets and passport, presidential glass floor
 Gold bottles, gold models, givin' up the ass for
 Instagram flicks, suckin' dick, fuck is this?
 One more sucker wavin' with a flashy wrist
 My defense mechanism tell me to get him
 Quickly because he got it
 It's a recession, then why the fuck he at King of Diamonds?
 No more livin' poor, meet my four-four
 When I see 'em, put the per diem on the floor
 Now Kendrick, know they're your co-workers
 But it's gon' take a lot 'fore this pistol go cold turkey
 Now I can watch his watch on the TV and be okay
 But see I'm on the clock once that watch landin' in LA
 Remember steal from the rich and givin' it back to the poor?
 Well, that's me at these awards""
 I guess my grandmama was warnin' a boy
 She said...
 ""Shit don't change until you get up and wash yo' ass, nigga
 Shit don't change until you get up and wash yo' ass, boy
 Shit don't change until you get up and wash yo' ass, nigga
 Oh now, slow down""
 And once upon a time, in a city so divine
 Called West Side Compton, there stood a little nigga
 He was five-foot something, dazed and confused
 Talented but still under the neighborhood ruse
 You can take your boy out the hood
 But you can't take the hood out the homie
 Took his show money, stashed it in the mozey wozey
 Hollywood's nervous
 Fuck you, goodnight, thank you much for your service",,,,,,,2014/15,"No Excuses Studios, Santa Monica, California, USA;Chalice Recording Studios, Hollywood, California, USA;Downtown Music Studios, SoHo, Lower Manhattan, New York City, New York, USA",Rahki;Tommy Black,"Derek ""MixedByAli"" Ali;James Hunt","Derek ""MixedByAli"" Ali",Mike Bozzi,Kendrick Duckworth;Columbus Smith;Fredrik Halldin;Sam Barsh,,,,,,Kendrick Lamar;Dave Free;Vladimir Sepetov,Dave Free,"James Hunt;Derek ""MixedByAli"" Ali","Anthony ""Top Dawg"" Tiffith;Dr. Dre",Dave Free;Roberto Reyes;Moosa;Punch,,,,,,,Gabriel Noel,Pedro Castro,,,Gabriel Noel,,,Sam Barsh,,,,,,,Sounwave;Terrace Martin;Kamasi Washington,David Kim;Thomas Cullison,,,,Paul Cartwright,Kendrick Lamar;Bilal;Anna Wise;Snoop Dawg;Taz Arnold,,http://www.kendricklamar.com/sites/g/files/aaj321/f/styles/suzuki_breakpoints_image_mobile-lg/public/release/202103/ab67616d0000b273e69c637a33eeb3f072d8f57c.jpg?itok=9uVcZPPg,Denis Rouvre;Kendrick Lamar;Dave Free;Vladimir Sepetov,Denis Rouvre;Diego Cambiaso;Roberto Reyes;Dave Free,,,,,https://t2.genius.com/unsafe/857x0/https%3A%2F%2Fimages.genius.com%2Fb13add5fa81e69993e4338a999be6ce6.752x752x1.png,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/To_Pimp_a_Butterfly,https://www.allmusic.com/album/to-pimp-a-butterfly-mw0002835159/credits,,271,4.52,0.08,,Yes,2,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1,2,,,,,1,,1,,,,,,,,,,,3,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,2,1,,,,,,1,,,,,,,3,,,,,,,,,,,,,1,,,,,,,,,,,,,2,,,,1,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1,,,,,,,,,,,
These Walls,To Pimp a Butterfly,A Blank Letter by Kendrick Lamar,5,5:00,Bilal;Anna Wise;Thundercat,Studio,3,15 Mar 15,16,"I remember you was conflicted, misusing your influence
 Sometimes, I did the same
 If these walls could talk
 If these walls could talk
 If these walls could talk
 If these walls could talk
 If these walls could talk
 If these walls could talk
 Sex
 She just want to close her eyes and sway
 With you, with you, with you (Ah, come on)
 Exercise her right to work it out
 It's true, it's true, it's true
 Shout out to the birthday girls
 Say hey (Hey), say hey (Hey), (Ah, girl)
 Everyone deserves a night to play (Play)
 She plays, only when you tell her no
 If these walls could talk
 I can feel your reign when it cries, gold lives inside of you
 If these walls could talk
 I love it when I’m in it, I love it when I’m in it
 If these walls could talk, they’d tell me to swim good
 No boat, I float better than he would
 No life jacket, I’m not the God of Nazareth
 But your flood can be misunderstood
 Walls telling me they full of pain, resentment
 Need someone to live in them just to relieve tension
 Me, I’m just a tenant
 Landlord said these walls vacant more than a minute
 These walls are vulnerable, exclamation
 Interior pink, color coordinated
 I interrogated every nook and cranny
 I mean, it's still amazing, before they couldn’t stand me
 These walls want to cry tears
 These walls happier when I’m here
 These walls never could hold up
 Every time I come around, demolition might crush
 If these walls could talk
 I can feel your reign when it cries, gold lives inside of you
 If these walls could talk
 I love it when I’m in it, I love it when I’m in it
 If these walls could talk, they’d tell me to go deep
 Yelling at me continuously, I can see
 Your defense mechanism is my decision
 Knock these walls down, that’s my religion
 Walls feeling like they ready to close in
 I suffocate, then catch my second wind
 I resonate in these walls
 I don’t know how long I can wait in these walls
 I’ve been on the streets too long
 Looking at you from the outside in
 They sing the same old song
 About how they walls always the cleanest
 I beg to differ, I must’ve missed them
 I’m not involved, I’d rather diss 'em
 I’d rather call on you, put your wall up
 'Cause when I come around, demolition gon’ crush
 If these walls could talk
 I can feel your reign when it cries, gold lives inside of you
 If these walls could talk
 I love it when I’m in it, I love it when I’m in it
 If your walls could talk, they’d tell you it’s too late
 Your destiny accepted your fate
 Burn accessories and stash them on the yard
 Take the recipe, the Bible and God
 Wall telling you that commissary is low
 Race wars happening, no calling CO
 No calling your mother to save you
 Homies to say you're irrepetible, not acceptable
 Your behavior is Sammy the Bull like
 A killer that turned snitch
 Walls is telling me you a bitch
 You pray for appeals hoping the warden would afford them
 That sentence so important
 Walls telling you to listen to Sing About Me
 Retaliation is strong, you even dream 'bout me
 Killed my homeboy and God spared your life
 Dumb criminal got indicted same night
 So when you play this song, rewind the first verse
 About me abusing my power so you can hurt
 About me and her in the shower whenever she horny
 About me and her in the after hours of the morning
 About her baby daddy currently serving life
 And how she think about you until we meet up at night
 About the only girl that cared about you when you asked her
 And how she fuckin' on a famous rapper
 Walls can talk (Talk)
 I remember you was conflicted
 Misusing your influence
 Sometimes I did the same
 Abusing my power, full of resentment
 Resentment that turned into a deep depression

u,To Pimp a Butterfly,A Blank Letter by Kendrick Lamar,6,4:28,,Studio,3,15 Mar 15,16,"Loving you is complicated, loving you is complicated
 Loving you is complicated, loving you is complicated
 Loving you is complicated, loving you is complicated
 Loving you is complicated, loving you is complicated
 Loving you is complicated, loving you is complicated
 I place blame on you still, place shame on you still
 Feel like you ain't shit, feel like you don't feel
 Confidence in yourself, breakin' on marble floors
 Watchin' anonymous strangers, tellin' me that I'm yours
 But you ain't shit, I'm convinced your tolerance nothin' special
 What can I blame you for? Nigga, I can name several
 Situations, I'll start with your little sister bakin'
 A baby inside, just a teenager, where your patience?
 Where was your antennas?
 Where was the influence you speak of?
 You preached in front of one-hunnid-thousand but never reached her
 I fuckin' tell you fuckin' failure—you ain't no leader!
 I never liked you, forever despise you—I don't need ya!
 The world don't need ya, don't let them deceive ya
 Numbers lie too, fuck your pride too, that's for dedication
 Thought money would change you, made you more complacent
 Fuckin' hate you, I hope you embrace it, I swear—
 Loving you is complicated, loving you is complicated
 Loving you is complicated, loving you is complicated
 Loving you is complicated, loving you is complicated
 Loving you is complicated, loving you is complicated
 Loving you is complicated, loving you is complicated
 Lovin' you, lovin' you, not lovin' you, 100 proof
 I can feel your vibe and recognize that you're ashamed of me
 Yes, I hate you, too
 (Loving you ain't really complicated)
 ""Housekeeping, housekeeping""
 (What I got to do to get to you?)
 ""¡Abre la puerta! ¡Abre la puerta tengo que limpiar el cuarto!""
 (To you)
 ""¡Es que no hay mucho tiempo tengo que limpiar el cuarto!""
 (Loving you ain't really complicated)
 ""¡Disculpe!""
 (What I got to do to get to you?)
 (To you)
 Are you the reason why mom and them leavin'
 No, you ain't shit, you say you love 'em, I know you don't mean it
 I know you irresponsible, selfish, in denial, can't help it
 Your trials and tribulations a burden, everyone felt it
 Everyone heard it, multiple shots, corners cryin' out
 You was deserted, where was your antennas again?
 Where was your presence? Where was your support that you pretend?
 You ain’t no brother, you ain’t no disciple, you ain’t no friend
 A friend never leave Compton for profit, or leave his best friend, little brother
 You promised you’d watch him before they shot him
 Where was your antennas? On the road, bottles and bitches
 You FaceTimed him one time, that's unforgiven
 You even FaceTimed instead of a hospital visit
 Guess you thought he'd recover well
 Third surgery, they couldn't stop the bleeding for real
 Then he died, God himself will say, ""You fuckin' failed,"" you ain't try
 I know your secrets, nigga, mood swings is frequent, nigga
 I know depression is restin' on your heart for two reasons, nigga
 I know you and a couple block boys ain't been speakin', nigga
 Y'all damn near beefin', I see it and you're the reason, nigga
 And if this bottle could talk
 I cry myself to sleep, bitch, everything is your fault
 Faults breakin' to pieces, earthquakes on every weekend
 Because you shook as soon as you knew confinement was needed
 I know your secrets, don't let me tell 'em to the world
 About that shit you thinkin' and that time you, I'm 'bout to hurl
 I'm fucked up, but I ain't as fucked up as you
 You just can't get right, I think your heart made of bullet proof
 Should've killed yo' ass long time ago
 You should've felt that black revolver blast a long time ago
 And if these mirrors could talk it'd say, ""You gotta go""
 And if I told your secrets the world'll know money can't stop a suicidal weakness",,,,,,,2014/15,"No Excuses Studios, Santa Monica, California, USA;Downtown Music Studios, SoHo, Lower Manhattan, New York City, New York, USA",Taz Arnold;Whoarei;Sounwave,"Derek ""MixedByAli"" Ali;Matthew Schaeffer","Derek ""MixedByAli"" Ali",Mike Bozzi,Kendrick Duckworth;Taz Arnold;Michael Brown,,,,,,Kendrick Lamar;Dave Free;Vladimir Sepetov,Dave Free,"James Hunt;Derek ""MixedByAli"" Ali;Matt Schaeffer","Anthony ""Top Dawg"" Tiffith;Dr. Dre",Dave Free;Roberto Reyes;Moosa;Punch,,,Terrace Martin,,Adam Turchan,,,,,,,Marlon Williams,,Terrace Martin,,,,,,,Sounwave;Terrace Martin;Kamasi Washington,David Kim;Thomas Cullison,Kamasi Washington,,,,Kendrick Lamar;Bilal;Jessica Vielmas;SZA,,http://www.kendricklamar.com/sites/g/files/aaj321/f/styles/suzuki_breakpoints_image_mobile-lg/public/release/202103/ab67616d0000b273e69c637a33eeb3f072d8f57c.jpg?itok=9uVcZPPg,Denis Rouvre;Kendrick Lamar;Dave Free;Vladimir Sepetov,Denis Rouvre;Diego Cambiaso;Roberto Reyes;Dave Free,,,,,https://t2.genius.com/unsafe/857x0/https%3A%2F%2Fimages.genius.com%2Fb13add5fa81e69993e4338a999be6ce6.752x752x1.png,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/To_Pimp_a_Butterfly,https://www.allmusic.com/album/to-pimp-a-butterfly-mw0002835159/credits,,268,4.47,0.07,,Yes,153,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,2,,,,,,,1,,,,1,,,,,,,1,,1,,,,,2,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1,,,,,,,,,,,,1,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1,,,,

 I'm fucked up, homie, you fucked up
 But if God got us, then we gon' be alright
 Nigga, we gon' be alright
 Nigga, we gon' be alright
 We gon' be alright
 Do you hear me, do you feel me? We gon' be alright
 Nigga, we gon' be alright
 Huh? We gon' be alright
 Nigga, we gon' be alright
 Do you hear me, do you feel me? We gon' be alright
 Uh, and when I wake up
 I recognize you're looking at me for the pay cut
 But homicide be looking at you from the face down
 What MAC-11 even boom with the bass down?
 Schemin', and let me tell you 'bout my life
 Painkillers only put me in the twilight
 Where pretty pussy and Benjamin is the highlight
 Now tell my momma I love her, but this what I like, Lord knows
 Twenty of 'em in my Chevy, tell 'em all to come and get me
 Reaping everything I sow, so my karma coming heavy
 No preliminary hearings on my record
 I'm a motherfucking gangster in silence for the record, uh
 Tell the world I know it's too late
 Boys and girls, I think I've gone cray
 Drown inside my vices all day
 Won't you please believe when I say
 Wouldn't you know
 We been hurt, been down before
 Nigga, when our pride was low
 Lookin' at the world like, ""Where do we go?""
 Nigga, and we hate po-po
 Wanna kill us dead in the street fo sho'

 Do you hear me, do you feel me? We gon' be alright
 What you want you, a house⁠? You, a car?
 40 acres and a mule? A piano, a guitar?
 Anything, see my name is Lucy, I'm your dog
 Motherfucker, you can live at the mall
 I can see the evil, I can tell it, I know it's illegal
 I don't think about it, I deposit every other zero
 Thinking of my partner, put the candy, paint it on the Regal
 Digging in my pocket, ain't a profit big enough to feed you
 Every day my logic get another dollar just to keep you
 In the presence of your chico... Ah!
 I don't talk about it, be about it, every day I sequel
 If I got it then you know you got it, Heaven, I can reach you
 Pat Dawg, Pat Dawg, Pat Dawg, my dog, that's all
 Bick back and Chad, I trap the bag for y'all
 I rap, I black on track so rest assured
 My rights, my wrongs; I write 'til I'm right with God

 I keep my head up high
 I cross my heart and hope to die
 Lovin' me is complicated
 Too afraid of a lot of changes
 I'm alright, and you're a favorite
 Dark nights in my prayers
 I remembered you was conflicted
 Misusing your influence, sometimes I did the same

 What's wrong, nigga?
 I thought you was keeping it gangsta
 I thought this what you wanted
 They say if you scared, go to church
 But remember, he knows the Bible too
 Now, baby, when I get you, get you, get you, get you
 I'ma go hit the throttle with you
 Smoking, lokin', poking that doja 'til I'm idle with you
 'Cause I (want you)
 Now, baby, when I'm riding here, I'm riding dirty
 Registration is out of service
 Smoking, lokin', drinking that potion, you can see me swerving
 'Cause I (want you)
 (I want you more than you know)
 I remember you took me to the mall last week, baby
 You looked me in my eyes about four, five times
 'Til I was hypnotized, then you clarified
 That I (want you)
 You said Sherane ain't got nothing on Lucy
 I said, ""You crazy?""
 Roses are red, violets are blue
 But me and you both pushing up daisies if I (want you)

 You said to me, you said your name was Lucy
 I said, ""Where's Ricardo?""
 You said, ""Oh, no, not the show""
 Then you spit a little rap to me like this
 When I turned twenty-six, I was like, ""Oh, shit""
 You said to me, I remember what you said too, you said:
 ""My name is Lucy, Kendrick, you introduced me, Kendrick
 Usually I don’t do this but I see you and me, Kendrick
 Lucy give you no worries, Lucy got million stories
 About these rappers that I came after when they was boring
 Lucy gon' fill your pockets
 Lucy gon' move your mama out of Compton
 Inside the gi-gantic mansion like I promised
 Lucy just want your trust and loyalty, avoiding me?
 It's not so easy, I'm at these functions accordingly
 Kendrick, Lucy don't slack a minute, Lucy work harder
 Lucy gon' call you even when Lucy know you love your Father
 I'm Lucy, I loosely heard prayers on your first album, truly
 Lucy don't mind, 'cause at the end of the day you'll pursue me
 Lucy go get it, Lucy not timid, Lucy up front
 Lucy got paperwork on top of paperwork
 I want you to know that Lucy got you
 All your life I watched you
 And now you all grown up to sign this contract, if that’s possible""

 I need that
 I need that sloppy
 That sloppy (Yo, yo, yo)
 Like a Chevy in quicksand
 Yeah
 That sloppy
 This feelin' is unmatched
 This feelin' is brought to you by adrenaline and good rap
 Black Pendleton ball cap (West, west, west)
 We don't share the same synonym, fall back (West, west, west)
 Been in it before internet had new acts
 Mimicking radio's nemesis made me wack
 My innocence limited, the experience lacked
 Ten of us with no tentative tactic that cracked
 The mind of a literate writer, but I did it, in fact
 You admitted it once I submitted it, wrapped in plastic
 Remember scribblin', scratchin' diligent sentences backwards
 Visiting freestyle cyphers for your reaction
 Now, I can live in a stadium, pack it the fastest
 Gamblin' Benjamin benefits, sinnin' in traffic
 Spinnin' women in cartwheels, linen fabric on fashion
 Winnin' in every decision, Kendrick is master that mastered it
 Isn't it lovely how menaces turned attraction?
 Pivotin' rappers, finish your fraction while writing blue magic
 Thank God for rap
 I would say it got me a plaque, but what's better than that?
 The fact it brought me back home
 We been waitin' for you
 Waitin' for you
 Waitin' for you
 Waitin' for you
 I know everything
 I know everything, know myself
 I know morality, spirituality, good and bad health
 I know fatality might haunt you
 I know everything
 I know Compton, I know street shit, I know shit that's conscious
 I know everything, I know lawyers, advertisement and sponsors
 I know wisdom, I know bad religion, I know good karma
 I know everything, I know history
 I know the universe works mentally
 I know the perks of bullshit isn't meant for me
 I know everything, I know cars, clothes, hoes, and money
 I know loyalty, I know respect, I know those that's ornery
 I know everything, the highs, the lows, the groupies, the junkies
 I know if I'm generous at heart, I don't need recognition
 The way I'm rewarded—well, that's God's decision
 I know you know that line's for Compton School District
 Just give it to the kids, don’t gossip 'bout how it was distributed
 I know how people work
 I know the price of life, I'm knowin' how much it’s worth
 I know what I know, and I know it well not to ever forget
 Until I realized I didn’t know shit, the day I came home
 We been waitin' for you
 Waitin' for you
 Waitin' for you
 Waitin' for you
 I met a little boy that resembled my features
 Nappy afro, gap in his smile, hand-me-down sneakers
 Bounced through the crowd
 Run a number on man and woman that crossed him
 Sun beamin' on his beady beads, exhausted
 Tossin' footballs with his ashy, black ankles
 Breakin' new laws mama passed on home trainin'
 He looked at me and said, ""Kendrick, you do know my language
 You just forgot because of what public schools had painted
 Oh, I forgot, 'Don't Kill My Vibe', that's right, you're famous
 I used to watch on Channel 5, TV was taken
 But never mind, you're here right now, don't you mistake it
 It's just a new trip, take a glimpse of your family ancestor
 Make a new list of everything you thought was progress
 And that was bullshit, I know your life is full of turmoil
 Spoiled by fantasies of who you are, I feel bad for you
 I can attempt to enlighten you without frightenin' you
 If you resist, I'll back off quick, go catch a flight or two
 But if you pick destiny over rest-in-peace
 Then be an advocate, tell your homies, especially
 To come back home""

 Tell me something, think I'm losing my mind, ah!
 I say, where you at? From the front to the back
 I'm lookin' for you, I react only when you react
 Ah, I thought I found you, back in the ghetto
 When I was seventeen with the .38 special
 Maybe you're in a dollar bill, maybe you're not real
 Maybe only the wealthy get to know how you feel
 Maybe I'm paranoid, ha, maybe I don't need you anyway
 Don't lie to me, I'm suicidal anyway
 I can be your advocate
 I can preach for you if you tell me what the matter is",,,,,,,2014/15,"No Excuses Studios, Santa Monica, California, USA;Downtown Music Studios, SoHo, Lower Manhattan, New York City, New York, USA",Knxwledge;Taz Arnold,"Derek ""MixedByAli"" Ali;James Hunt","Derek ""MixedByAli"" Ali",Mike Bozzi,Kendrick Duckworth;Glen Boothe;Taz Arnold,,Wishful Thinking;On Your Own,Sly and the Family Stone;Lalah Hathaway,"Sylvester Stewart;Lalah Hathaway,Rahsaan Patterson,Rex Rideout",,Kendrick Lamar;Dave Free;Vladimir Sepetov,Dave Free,"Derek ""MixedByAli"" Ali","Anthony ""Top Dawg"" Tiffith;Dr. Dre",Dave Free;Roberto Reyes;Moosa;Punch,,,Terrace Martin,,,,,,,,,,,Terrace Martin,,,,,,,Sounwave;Terrace Martin;Kamasi Washington,David Kim;Thomas Cullison,,,,,Kendrick Lamar;Bilal;Taz Arnold;Lalah Hathaway,Terrace Martin,http://www.kendricklamar.com/sites/g/files/aaj321/f/styles/suzuki_breakpoints_image_mobile-lg/public/release/202103/ab67616d0000b273e69c637a33eeb3f072d8f57c.jpg?itok=9uVcZPPg,Denis Rouvre;Kendrick Lamar;Dave Free;Vladimir Sepetov,Denis Rouvre;Diego Cambiaso;Roberto Reyes;Dave Free,,,,,,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/To_Pimp_a_Butterfly,https://www.allmusic.com/album/to-pimp-a-butterfly-mw0002835159/credits,,283,4.72,0.08,"Bitch, Don't Kill My Vibe",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1,,2,,,,,,,,,,,1,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,X,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,2,3,,,,,1,1,,5,,,,,3,,,,,1,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,2,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1,,,,,,,,,,,
Hood Politics,To Pimp a Butterfly,A Blank Letter by Kendrick Lamar,10,4:52,,Studio,3,15 Mar 15,16,"K-Dot, pick up the phone, nigga
 Every time I call, it's going to voicemail
 Don't tell me they got you on some weirdo rap shit, nigga
 No socks and skinny jeans and shit, ha
 Ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-haha
 Call me on Shaniqua's phone!
 I been A-1 since day one, you niggas boo-boo
 Your home boy, your block that you're from, boo-boo
 Lil hoes you went to school with, boo-boo
 Baby mama and your new bitch, boo-boo
 We was in the hood, fourteen with the deuce-deuce
 14 years later, going hard like we used to, on the dead homies
 On the dead homies
 I don't give a fuck about no politics in rap, my nigga
 Our lil' homie Stunna Deuce ain't never comin' back, my nigga
 So you better go hard every time you jump on wax, my nigga
 Fuck what they talkin' 'bout, your shit is where it's at, my nigga
 Came in this game, you stuck your fangs in this game
 You wore no chain in this game, your hood, your name in this game
 Now you double up, time to bubble up the bread and huddle up
 Stickin' to the scripts, now, here, if them Benjamins go cuddle up
 Skip, hop, drip, drop
 Flip, flop with the white tube sock
 It goes, ""Sherm sticks, burn this""
 That's what the product smell like when the chemicals mix
 50-nigga salute, out the Compton zoo, with the extras
 El Co's, Monte Carlos, Road Kings, and dressers
 Rip Ridaz, P-Funkers, Mexicans, they fuck with you
 Asians, they fuck with you, nobody can fuck with you
 I been A-1 since day one, you niggas boo-boo
 Your homeboy, your block that you're from, boo-boo
 Lil hoes you went to school with, boo-boo
 Baby mama and your new bitch, boo-boo
 We was in the hood, fourteen with the deuce-deuce
 14 years later, going hard like we used to, on the dead homies
 On the dead homies
 Hopped out the Caddy, just got my dick sucked
 The little homies called and said, ""The enemies done cliqued up""
 Oh, yeah? Puto want to squabble with mi barrio?
 Oh, yeah? Tell 'em they can run it for the cardio
 Oh, yeah? Everything is everything, it's scandalous
 Slow motion for the ambulance, the project filled with cameras
 The LAPD gamblin', scramblin', football numbers slanderin'
 Niggas' names on paper—you snitched all summer
 Streets don’t fail me now
 They tell me it's a new gang in town
 From Compton to Congress
 Set-trippin’ all around
 Ain't nothin' new but a flu of new Demo-Crips and Re-Blood-icans
 Red state versus a blue state—which one you governin'?
 They give us guns and drugs, call us thugs
 Make it they promise to fuck with you
 No condom, they fuck with you, Obama say, ""What it do?""
 Obama say, ""What it do?""
 Obama say, ""What it do?""
 Obama say, ""What it do?""
 I been A-1 since day one, you niggas boo-boo
 Your homeboy, your block that you're from, boo-boo
 Lil hoes you went to school with, boo-boo
 Baby mama and your new bitch, boo-boo
 We was in the hood, 14 with the deuce-deuce
 14 years later, going hard like we used to, on the dead homies
 On the dead homies
 Everybody want to talk about who this and who that
 Who the realest and who wack, or who white or who Black
 Critics want to mention that they miss when hip-hop was rappin'
 Motherfucker, if you did, then Killer Mike'd be platinum
 Y’all priorities fucked up, put energy in wrong shit
 Hennessy and Crown Vic, my memory been gone since
 Don’t ask about no camera blocking at award shows
 No, don’t ask about my bitch, no, don’t ask about my Vogues
 'Less you askin' me about power, yeah, I got a lot of it
 I'm the only nigga next to Snoop that can push the button
 Had the Coast on standby
 “K-Dot, what up? I heard they opened up Pandora’s box”
 I box ‘em all in, by a landslide
 Nah, homie, we too sensitive, it spill out to the streets
 I make the call and get the Coast involved, then history repeats
 But I resolved inside that private hall while sitting down with Jay
 He said, ""It's funny how one verse could fuck up the game""
 I been A-1 since day one, you niggas boo-boo
 I remember you was conflicted
 Misusing your influence
 Sometimes I did the same
 Abusing my power full of resentment
 Resentment that turned into a deep depression
 Found myself screaming in a hotel room
 I didn't want to self-destruct
 The evils of Lucy was all around me
 So I went running for answers
 Until I came home
 But that didn't stop survivors guilt
 Going back and forth
 Trying to convince myself the stripes I earned
 Or maybe how A-1 my foundation was
 But while my loved ones was fighting a continuous war
 Back in the city
 I was entering a new one",,,,Yes,,,2014/15,"No Excuses Studios, Santa Monica, California, USA;Downtown Music Studios, SoHo, Lower Manhattan, New York City, New York, USA",Tae Beast;Sounwave;Thundercat,"Derek ""MixedByAli"" Ali;James Hunt","Derek ""MixedByAli"" Ali",Mike Bozzi,Kendrick Duckworth;Donte Perkins;Mark Spears;Stephen Bruner,,All for Myself,Sufjan Stevens,Sufjan Stevens,,Kendrick Lamar;Dave Free;Vladimir Sepetov,Dave Free,"Derek ""MixedByAli"" Ali","Anthony ""Top Dawg"" Tiffith;Dr. Dre",Dave Free;Roberto Reyes;Moosa;Punch,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Terrace Martin;Robert Sput Searight,,,,,,,Sounwave;Terrace Martin;Kamasi Washington,David Kim;Thomas Cullison,,,,,Kendrick Lamar;Anna Wise;Bilal;Preston Harris;Dion Friley,,http://www.kendricklamar.com/sites/g/files/aaj321/f/styles/suzuki_breakpoints_image_mobile-lg/public/release/202103/ab67616d0000b273e69c637a33eeb3f072d8f57c.jpg?itok=9uVcZPPg,Denis Rouvre;Kendrick Lamar;Dave Free;Vladimir Sepetov,Denis Rouvre;Diego Cambiaso;Roberto Reyes;Dave Free,,,,,,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/To_Pimp_a_Butterfly,https://www.allmusic.com/album/to-pimp-a-butterfly-mw0002835159/credits,,292,4.87,0.08,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1,,,,1,,2,,,,,,,,,,,,,3,,,,,,,,1,1,,,,,,,,,,,,,,X,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,2,,,,1,,,,,,,,,,1,,1,1,,,,,,,2,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,2,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
How Much a Dollar Cost,To Pimp a Butterfly,A Blank Letter by Kendrick Lamar,11,4:21,James Fauntleroy;Ronald Isley,Studio,3,15 Mar 15,16,"How much a dollar really cost?
 The question is detrimental, paralyzin' my thoughts
 Parasites in my stomach keep me with a gut feeling, y'all
 Gotta see how I’m chillin' once I park this luxury car
 Hopping out feeling big as Mutombo
 ""20 on pump 6,"" dirty Marcellus called me Dumbo
 Twenty years ago, can't forget
 Now I can lend him a ear or two
 How to stack these residuals tenfold
 The liberal concept of what men'll do
 ""20 on 6,"" he didn't hear me
 Indigenous African only spoke Zulu
 My American tongue was leery
 Walked out the gas station
 A homeless man with a semi-tan complexion
 Asked me for ten rand, stressin' about dry land
 Deep water, powder blue skies that crack open
 A piece of crack that he wanted, I knew he was smokin'
 He begged and pleaded
 Asked me to feed him twice, I didn't believe it
 Told him, ""Beat it""
 Contributin' money just for his pipe—I couldn't see it
 He said, ""My son, temptation is one thing that I've defeated
 Listen to me, I want a single bill from you
 Nothin' less, nothin' more""
 I told him I ain't have it and closed my door
 Tell me; how much a dollar cost?
 It's more to feed your mind
 Water, sun and love, the one you love
 All you need, the air you breathe
 He's starin' at me in disbelief
 My temper is buildin', he's starin' at me, I grab my key
 He's starin' at me, I started the car, then I tried to leave
 And somethin' told me to keep it in park until I could see
 The reason why he was mad at a stranger
 Like I was supposed to save him
 Like I'm the reason he's homeless and askin' me for a favor
 He's starin' at me, his eyes followed me with no laser
 He's starin' at me, I notice that his stare is contagious
 'Cause now I'm starin' back at him, feelin' some type of disrespect
 If I could throw a bat at him, it'd be aimin' at his neck
 I never understood someone beggin' for goods
 Askin' for handouts, takin' it if they could
 And this particular person just had it down pat
 Starin' at me for the longest until he finally asked
 ""Have you ever opened up Exodus 14?
 A humble man is all that we ever need""
 Tell me; how much a dollar cost?
 It's more to feed your mind
 Water, sun and love, the one you love
 All you need, the air you breathe
 Guilt trippin' and feelin' resentment
 I never met a transient that demanded attention
 They got me frustrated, indecisive and power trippin'
 Sour emotions got me lookin' at the universe different
 I should distance myself, I should keep it relentless
 My selfishness is what got me here, who the fuck I'm kiddin'?
 So I'ma tell you like I told the last bum
 Crumbs and pennies, I need all of mines
 And I recognize this type of panhandlin' all the time
 I got better judgment, I know when nigga's hustlin', keep in mind
 When I was strugglin', I did compromise, now I comprehend
 I smell Grandpa's old medicine, reekin' from your skin
 Moonshine and gin, nigga you're babblin', your words ain't flatterin'
 I'm imaginin' Denzel but lookin' at O'Neal
 Kazaam is sad thrills, your gimmick is mediocre
 The jig is up, I seen you from a mile away losin' focus
 And I'm insensitive, and I lack empathy
 He looked at me and said, ""Your potential is bittersweet""
 I looked at him and said, ""Every nickel is mines to keep""
 He looked at me and said, ""Know the truth, it'll set you free
 You're lookin' at the Messiah, the son of Jehovah, the higher power
 The choir that spoke the word, the Holy Spirit
 The nerve of Nazareth, and I'll tell you just how much a dollar cost
 The price of having a spot in Heaven, embrace your loss—I am God""
 I washed my hands, I said my grace
 What more do you want from me?
 Tears of a clown, guess I'm not all what it's all meant to be
 Shades of grey will never change if I condone

Complexion (A Zulu Love),To Pimp a Butterfly,A Blank Letter by Kendrick Lamar,12,4:23,Rapsody,Studio,3,15 Mar 15,16,"I'm with this
 Complexion (Two-step)
 Complexion don't mean a thing (It's a Zulu love)
 Complexion (Two-step)
 It all feels the same (It's a Zulu love)
 Uh, Dark as the midnight hour or bright as the mornin' sun
 Give a fuck about your complexion, I know what the Germans done
 Sneak (Dissin')
 Sneak me through the back window, I’m a good field nigga
 I made a flower for you outta cotton just to chill with you
 You know I'd go the distance, you know I'm ten toes down
 Even if master listenin', cover your ears, he 'bout to mention
 Complexion (Two-step)
 Complexion don't mean a thing (It's a Zulu love)
 Oh, Complexion (Two-step)
 It all feels the same (It's a Zulu love)
 Dark as the midnight hour, or bright as the mornin' sun
 Brown skinned, but your blue eyes tell me your mama can't run
 Sneak (Dissin')
 Sneak me through the back window, I’m a good field nigga
 I made a flower for you outta cotton just to chill with you
 You know I'd go the distance, you know I'm ten toes down
 Even if master's listenin', I got the world's attention
 So I'ma say somethin' that's vital and critical for survival
 Of mankind, a feline color should never rival
 Beauty is what you make it, I used to be so mistaken
 By different shades of faces
 Then Whit' told me, ""A woman is woman, love the creation""
 It all came from God, then you was my confirmation
 I came to where you reside
 And looked around to see more sights for sore eyes
 Let the Willie Lynch theory reverse a million times with...
 Complexion (Two-step)
 Complexion don't mean a thing (It's a Zulu love)
 Oh, Complexion (Two-step)
 It all feels the same (It's a Zulu love)
 You like it, I love it
 You like it, I love it
 You like it, I love it
 You like it, I love it
 You like it, I love it
 You like it, I love it
 You like it, I love it
 You like it, I love it
 (Where the homegirl Rapsody at?
 I need you to speak your mind real quick, loved one!)
 Let me talk my Stu Scott, ‘scuse me on my 2Pac
 Keep your head up, when did you stop loving thy
 Color of your skin? Color of your eyes
 That’s the real blues, baby, like you met Jay's baby
 You blew me away, you think more beauty in blue, green and grey
 All my solemn men up north, 12 years a slave
 Twelve years of age, thinkin' my shade too dark
 I love myself, I no longer need Cupid
 Enforcin' my dark side like a young George Lucas
 Light don’t mean you smart, bein' dark don’t make you stupid
 And frame of mind for them bustas, ain’t talkin' “Woo-hah!”
 Need a paradox for the pair of doc's they tutored
 Like two Todd's, L-L, you lose two times
 If you don’t see you beautiful in your complexion
 It ain’t complex to put it in context
 Find the air beneath the kite, that’s the context
 Yeah, baby, I’m conscious, ain’t no contest
 If you like it, I love it, all your earth tones been blessed
 Ain’t no stress, jiggaboos wanna be
 I ain’t talkin' Jay, I ain’t talkin' Bey
 I’m talkin' days we got school watchin' movie screens
 And spike your self-esteem
 The new James Bond gon' be black as me
 Black as brown, hazelnut, cinnamon, black tea
 And it’s all beautiful to me
 Call your brothers magnificent, call all the sisters queens
 We all on the same team, blues and pirus, know colors ain’t a thing
 Barefoot babies with no cares
 Teenage gun toters that don’t play fair, should I get out the car?
 I don’t see Compton, I see something much worse

The Blacker the Berry,To Pimp a Butterfly,A Blank Letter by Kendrick Lamar,13,5:28,,Studio,3,15 Mar 15,16,"Everything black, I don't want black (They want us to bow)
 I want everything black, I ain't need black (Down to our knees)
 Some white, some black, I ain't mean black (And pray to the God)
 I want everything black (We don't believe)
 Everything black, want all things black
 I don't need black, want everything black
 Don't need black, our eyes ain't black
 I own black, own everything black
 Six in the morn'
 Fire in the street
 Burn, baby, burn (You, you, you, you, you)
 That's all I wanna see (You, you, you, you, you)
 And sometimes I get off watchin' you die in vain
 It's such a shame they may call me crazy
 They may say I suffer from schizophrenia or somethin'
 But homie, you made me (You, you, you, you, you)
 Black don't crack, my nigga
 I'm the biggest hypocrite of 2015
 Once I finish this, witnesses will convey just what I mean
 Been feelin' this way since I was sixteen, came to my senses
 You never liked us anyway, fuck your friendship, I meant it
 I'm African-American, I'm African, I'm black as the moon
 Heritage of a small village, pardon my residence
 Came from the bottom of mankind
 My hair is nappy, my dick is big, my nose is round and wide
 You hate me don't you?
 You hate my people, your plan is to terminate my culture
 You're fuckin' evil
 I want you to recognize that I'm a proud monkey
 You vandalize my perception but can't take style from me
 And this is more than confession
 I mean I might press the button just so you know my discretion
 I'm guardin' my feelings, I know that you feel it
 You sabotage my community, makin' a killin'
 You made me a killer, emancipation of a real nigga
 The blacker the berry, the sweeter the juice
 The blacker the berry, the sweeter the juice
 The blacker the berry, the sweeter the juice
 The blacker the berry, the bigger I shoot
 I said they treat me like a slave, cah' me black
 Woi, we feel a whole heap of pain, cah' we black
 And man a say they put me inna chains, cah' we black
 Imagine now, big gold chains full of rocks
 How you no see the whip, left scars 'pon me back
 But now we have a big whip parked 'pon the block
 All them say we doomed from the start, cah' we black
 Remember this, every race start from the block, jus 'member dat
 I'm the biggest hypocrite of 2015
 Once I finish this, witnesses will convey just what I mean
 I mean, it's evident that I'm irrelevant to society
 That's what you're tellin' me, penitentiary would only hire me
 Curse me 'til I'm dead, church me with your fake prophesizing
 That I'ma be just another slave in my head
 Institutionalized manipulation and lies
 Reciprocation of freedom only live in your eyes
 You hate me don't you?
 I know you hate me just as much as you hate yourself
 Jealous of my wisdom and cards I dealt
 Watchin' me as I pull up, fill up my tank, then peel out
 Muscle cars like pull ups, show you what these big wheels 'bout, ah
 Black and successful, this black man meant to be special
 Katzkins on my radar, bitch, how can I help you?
 How can I tell you I'm making a killin'?
 You made me a killer, emancipation of a real nigga
 The blacker the berry, the sweeter the juice
 The blacker the berry, the sweeter the juice
 The blacker the berry, the sweeter the juice
 The blacker the berry, the bigger I shoot
 I said they treat me like a slave, cah' me black
 Woi, we feel a whole heap of pain, cah' we black
 And man a say they put me inna chains, cah' we black
 Imagine now, big gold chains full of rocks
 How you no see the whip, left scars 'pon me back
 But now we have a big whip parked 'pon the block
 All them say we doomed from the start, cah' we black
 Remember this, every race start from the block, jus 'member dat
 I'm the biggest hypocrite of 2015
 When I finish this if you listen then sure you will agree
 This plot is bigger than me, it's generational hatred
 It's genocism, it's grimy, little justification
 I'm African-American, I'm African
 I'm black as the heart of a fuckin' Aryan
 I'm black as the name of Tyrone and Darius, excuse my French
 But fuck you — no, fuck y'all, that's as blunt as it gets
 I know you hate me, don't you?
 You hate my people, I can tell 'cause it's threats when I see you
 I can tell 'cause your ways deceitful
 Know I can tell because you in love with that Desert Eagle
 Thinkin' maliciously, he get a chain then you gon' bleed him
 It's funny how Zulu and Xhosa might go to war
 Two tribal armies that wanna build and destroy
 Remind me of these Compton Crip gangs that live next door
 Beefin' with Pirus, only death settle the score
 So don't matter how much I say I like to preach with the Panthers
 Or tell Georgia State ""Marcus Garvey got all the answers""
 Or try to celebrate February like it's my B-Day
 Or eat watermelon, chicken, and Kool-Aid on weekdays
 Or jump high enough to get Michael Jordan endorsements
 Or watch BET 'cause urban support is important
 So why did I weep when Trayvon Martin was in the street
 When gang-banging make me kill a nigga blacker than me?

 Hey, y'all close that front door, y'all let flies in this motherfucker
 Close that door!
 My OG up in this motherfucker right now
 My pops man with the bottle of Hennessy in his hand, actin' a fool
 Hey, hey, babe, check it out, I'ma tell you what my momma had said, she like:
 I could spot you a mile away
 I could see your insecurities written all on your face
 So predictable your words, I know what you gonna say
 Who you foolin'? Oh, you assuming you can just come and hang
 With the homies but your level of realness ain't the same
 Circus acts only attract those that entertain
 Small talk, we know that it's all talk
 We live in the Laugh Factory every time they mention your name
 Askin' ""where the hoes at?"" to impress me
 Askin' ""where the moneybags?"" to impress me
 Say you got the burner stashed to impress me
 It's all in your head, homie
 Askin' ""where the plug at?"" to impress me
 Askin' ""where the juug at?"" to impress me
 Askin' ""where it's at?"" only upsets me
 You sound like the feds, homie
 You ain't gotta lie to kick it, my nigga
 You ain't gotta lie, you ain't gotta lie
 You ain't gotta lie to kick it, my nigga
 You ain't gotta try so hard
 You ain't gotta lie to kick it, my nigga
 You ain't gotta lie, you ain't gotta lie
 You ain't gotta lie to kick it, my nigga
 You ain't gotta try so hard
 And the world don't respect you
 And the culture don't accept you
 But you think it's all love
 And the girls gon' neglect you once your parody is done
 Reputation can't protect you if you never had one
 Jealousy (complex), emotional (complex)
 Self-pity (complex), under oath (complex)
 The loudest one in the room, nigga, that's a complex
 Let me put it back in proper context
 You ain't gotta lie to kick it, my nigga
 You ain't gotta lie, you ain't gotta lie
 You ain't gotta lie to kick it, my nigga
 You ain't gotta try so hard
 You ain't gotta lie to kick it, my nigga
 You ain't gotta lie, you ain't gotta lie
 You ain't gotta lie to kick it, my nigga

 Askin' ""where the plug at?"" to impress me
 Askin' ""where the juug at?"" to impress me
 Askin' ""where it's at?"" only upsets me
 You sound like the feds, homie
 What do you got to offer?
 Tell me before we off ya, put you deep in the coffin
 Been allergic to talkin', been a virgin to bullshit
 And sell a dream in the auction, tell me just who your boss is
 Niggas be fugazi, bitches be fugazi
 This is for fugazi
 Niggas and bitches who make habitual lyin' babies
 Bless them little hearts
 You can never persuade me
 You can never relate me to him, to her, or that to them
 Or you, the truth you love to bend
 In the back, in the bed, on the floor, that's your ho
 On the couch, in the mouth, I'll be out, really though
 See, loud, rich niggas got low money
 And loud, broke niggas got no money
 The irony behind it is so funny
 And I seen it all this past year
 Pass on some advice we feel:
 You ain't gotta lie to kick it, my nigga
 You ain't gotta lie, you ain't gotta lie
 You ain't gotta lie to kick it, my nigga
 You ain't gotta try so hard
 You ain't gotta lie to kick it, my nigga
 You ain't gotta lie, you ain't gotta lie

i,To Pimp a Butterfly,A Blank Letter by Kendrick Lamar,15,5:36,,Studio,3,15 Mar 15,16,"Is this mic on? (Hey, move this way, this way)
 Hey, Hey! Hey! Turn the mic up, c'mon, c'mon
 Is the mic on or not? I want the mic
 We're bringing up nobody, nobody...
 Nobody but the number one rapper in the world
 He done traveled all over the world
 He came back just to give you some game
 All of the little boys and girls, come up here
 (Ah, one two, one two, what's happening, fool?)
 Come right here, this is for you, come on up
 I done been through a whole lot (Kendrick Lamar!)
 Trial, tribulation, but I know God
 The Devil wanna put me in a bow tie (Make some noise, brother!)
 Pray that the holy water don't go dry
 As I look around me
 So many motherfuckers wanna down me
 But enemigo never drown me
 In front of a dirty double-mirror they found me
 And (I love myself)
 Huh, when you lookin' at me, tell me what do you see?
 (I love myself)
 Ahh, I put a bullet in the back of the back of the head of the police
 (I love myself)
 Uh, illuminated by the hand of God, boy, don't seem shy
 (I love myself)
 One day at a time, huh
 They wanna say it's a war outside, bomb in the street
 Gun in the hood, mob of police
 Rock on the corner with a line for the fiend
 And a bottle full of lean and a model on the scheme, uh
 These days of frustration keep y'all on tuck and rotation (Come to the front, yeah)
 I duck these cold faces, post up fi-fie-fo-fum basis
 Dreams of reality's peace (Oh, yeah)
 Blow steam in the face of the beast
 Sky could fall down, wind could cry now
 Look at me motherfucker I smile-
 And (I love myself)
 Uh, and when you lookin' at me, tell me what do you see?
 (I love myself)
 Ahh, I put a bullet in the back of the back of the head of the police
 (I love myself)
 Illuminated—
 All ya'll come to the front, y'all come up to the front
 (I love myself)
 Baby what about you? Come on
 (Crazy, what you gon' do?)
 Lift up your head and keep moving, (Keep moving) turn the mic up
 (Haunt you)
 Peace to fashion police, I wear my heart
 On my sleeve, let the runway start
 You know the miserable do love company
 What do you want from me and my scars?
 Everybody lack confidence, everybody lack confidence
 How many times my potential was anonymous?
 How many times the city making me promises?
 So I promise this, nigga
 (I love myself)
 Uh, and when you lookin' at me, tell me what do you see?
 (I love myself)
 Ahh, I put a bullet in the back of the back of the head of the police
 (I love myself)
 Huh, illuminated by the hand of God, boy don't seem shy
 (I love myself)
 Huh (Walk my bare feet) Huh (Walk my bare feet)
 Huh (Down, down valley deep) Huh (Down, down valley deep)
 (I love myself) Huh (Fi-fie-fo-fum) Huh (Fi-fie-fo-fum)
 (I love myself) Huh (My heart undone) one, two, three
 I went to war last night
 With an automatic weapon, don't nobody call a medic
 I'ma do it 'til I get it right (Oh no)
 I went to war last night (Night, night, night, night)
 I've been dealing with depression ever since an adolescent
 Duckin' every other blessin', I can never see the message
 I could never take the lead, I could never bob and weave
 From a negative and letting them annihilate me
 And it's evident I'm moving at a meteor speed
 Finna run into a building, lay my body...
 Not on my, not while I'm up here
 Not on my time, kill the music, not on my time
 We could save that shit for the streets
 We could save that shit, this for the kids, bro
 2015, niggas tired of playin' victim, dog
 Niggas ain't trying to play vic— TuTu, how many niggas we done lost?
 How many— Yan-Yan, how many we done lost?
 No for real, answer the que—, how many niggas we done lost bro?
 This—, this year alone
 Exactly, so we— we ain't got time to waste time, my nigga
 Niggas gotta make time, bro
 The judge make time, you know that, the judge make time, right?
 The judge make time so it ain’t shit
 It shouldn’t be shit for us to come out here and appreciate the little bit of life we got left, dog
 On the dead homies, Charlie P, you know that, bro
 You know that
 It’s— it's mando, right, it's mando
 And I s— I— And I— And I say this because I love you niggas, man
 I love all my niggas, bro
 Exac— enough said, enough said
 And we gon' get back to the show and move on, because that shit petty, my nigga
 Mic check, mic check, mic check, mic check, mic check
 We gon' do some acapella shit before we get back to-
 All my niggas listen, listen to this:
 I promised Dave I'd never use the phrase ""fuck nigga""
 He said, ""Think about what you saying: ""Fuck niggas""
 No better than Samuel on the Django
 No better than a white man with slave boats""
 Sound like I needed some soul searching
 My Pops gave me some game in real person
 Retraced my steps on what they never taught me
 Did my homework fast before government caught me
 So I'ma dedicate this one verse to Oprah
 On how the infamous, sensitive N-word control us
 So many artists gave her an explanation to hold us
 Well, this is my explanation straight from Ethiopia
 N-E-G-U-S definition: royalty; king royalty - wait listen
 N-E-G-U-S description: black emperor, king, ruler, now let me finish
 The history books overlook the word and hide it
 America tried to make it to a house divided
 The homies don't recognize we been using it wrong
 So I'ma break it down and put my game in a song
 N-E-G-U-S, say it with me, or say it no more
 Black stars can come and get me
 Take it from Oprah Winfrey, tell her she right on time

Mortal Man,To Pimp a Butterfly,A Blank Letter by Kendrick Lamar,16,12:07,,Studio,3,15 Mar 15,16,"Ohhh, ohhhh, woahhh
 Uh, yeah
 Uh, yeah
 Uh
 Yeah, uh
 The ghost of Mandela, hope my flows stay propellin'
 Let these words be your Earth and moon, you consume every message
 As I lead this army, make room for mistakes and depression
 And with that being said, my nigga, let me ask this question:
 When shit hit the fan, is you still a fan?
 When shit hit the fan—
 (one two, one two, one two)
 When shit hit the fan, is you still a fan?
 When shit hit the fan, is you still a fan?
 The ghost of Mandela, hope my flows stay propellin'
 Let these words be your Earth and moon, you consume every message
 As I lead this army, make room for mistakes and depression
 And with that being said, my nigga, let me ask this question:
 When shit hit the fan, is you still a fan?
 When shit hit the fan, is you still a fan?
 Won't you look to your left and right? Make sure you ask your friends
 When shit hit the fan, is you still a fan?
 Do you believe in me? Are you deceiving me?
 Could I let you down easily, is your heart where it need to be?
 Is your smile on permanent? Is your vow on lifetime?
 Would you know where the sermon is if I died in this next line?
 If I’m tried in a court of law, if the industry cut me off
 If the government want me dead, plant cocaine in my car
 Would you judge me a drug-head or see me as K. Lamar?
 Or question my character and degrade me on every blog?
 Want you to love me like Nelson, want you to hug me like Nelson
 I freed you from being a slave in your mind, you’re very welcome
 You tell me my song is more than a song, it’s surely a blessing
 But a prophet ain’t a prophet til they ask you this question:
 When shit hit the fan, is you still a fan?
 When shit hit the fan, is you still a fan?
 Won't you look to your left and right? Make sure you ask your friends
 When shit hit the fan, is you still a fan?
 The ghost of Mandela, hope my flows stay propellin'
 Let my words be your Earth and moon, you consume every message
 As I lead this army, make room for mistakes and depression
 And with that—
 Do you believe in me? How much you believe in her?
 You think she gon’ stick around if them 25 years occur?
 You think he can hold you down when you down behind bars, hurt?
 You think y’all on common ground if you promise to be the first? Can you be immortalized without your life being expired?
 Even though you share the same blood, is it worth the time?
 Like, who got your best interest?
 Like, how much are you dependent?
 How clutch are the people that say they love you?
 And who pretending?
 How tough is your skin when they turn you in?
 Do you show forgiveness?
 What brush do you bend when dusting your shoulders from being offended?
 What kind of den did they put you in when the lions start hissing?
 What kind of bridge did they burn?
 Revenge on your mind when it’s mentioned
 You wanna love like Nelson, you wanna be like Nelson
 You wanna walk in his shoes, but your peacemaking seldom
 You wanna be remembered that delivered the message
 That considered the blessing of everyone
 This your lesson for everyone, say;
 When shit hit the fan, is you still a fan?
 When shit hit the fan, is you still a fan?
 Won't you look to your left and right? Make sure you ask your friends
 When shit hit the fan, is you still a fan?
 The voice of Mandela, hope this flow stay propellin'
 Let my word be your Earth and moon, you consume every message
 As I lead this army, make room for mistakes and depression
 And if you riding with me, nigga—
 I been wrote off before, I got abandonment issues
 I hold grudges like bad judges, don’t let me resent you
 That’s not Nelson-like—want you to love me like Nelson
 I went to Robben’s Island analysing; that’s where his cell is
 So I could find clarity—like, how much you cherish me?
 Is this relationship a fake, or real as the heavens be?
 See I got to question it all; family, friends, fans, cats, dogs
 Trees, plants, grass, how the wind blow, Murphy’s Law
 Generation X—will I ever be your ex?
 Flaws of a baby step', mauled by the mouth a bit—pause
 Put me under stress, crawled under rocks, duckin' y’all
 It’s respect—but then tomorrow, put my back against the wall
 How many leaders you said you needed then left ‘em for dead?
 Is it Moses? Is it Huey Newton or Detroit Red?
 Is it Martin Luther? JFK? Shooter—you assassin
 Is it Jackie? Is it Jesse? Oh, I know it’s Michael Jackson—oh
 When shit hit the fan, is you still a fan?
 When shit hit the fan, is you still a fan?
 That nigga gave us ""Billie Jean,"" you say he touched those kids?
 When shit hit the fan, is you still a fan?
 The ghost of Mandela, hope my flows stay propelling
 Let my word be your Earth and moon, you consume every message
 As I lead this army, make room for mistakes and depression
 And if you riding with me, nigga, let me ask this question, nigga
 ""I remember you was conflicted
 Misusing your influence
 Sometimes I did the same
 Abusing my power, full of resentment
 Resentment that turned into a deep depression
 Found myself screaming in the hotel room
 I didn’t wanna self destruct
 The evils of Lucy was all around me
 So I went running for answers
 Until I came home
 But that didn’t stop survivor’s guilt
 Going back and forth trying to convince myself the stripes I earned
 Or maybe how A-1 my foundation was
 But while my loved ones was fighting the continuous war back in the city
 I was entering a new one
 A war that was based on apartheid and discrimination
 Made me wanna go back to the city and tell the homies what I learned
 The word was respect
 Just because you wore a different gang color than mine's
 Doesn’t mean I can’t respect you as a black man
 Forgetting all the pain and hurt we caused each other in these streets
 If I respect you, we unify and stop the enemy from killing us
 But I don’t know, I’m no mortal man
 Maybe I’m just another nigga”
 Shit and that’s all I wrote
 I was gonna call it ""Another Nigga"" but, it ain’t really a poem
 I just felt like it’s something you probably could relate to
 Other than that, now that I finally got a chance to holla at you
 I always wanted to ask you about a certain situa-
 About a metaphor actually, uh, you spoke on the ground
 What you mean by that, what the ground represent?
 The ground is gonna open up and swallow the evil
 Right
 That’s how I see it, my word is bond
 I see—and the ground is the symbol for the poor people
 Right
 The poor people is gonna open up this whole world
 And swallow up the rich people
 'Cause the rich people gonna be so fat
 And they gonna be so appetizing, you know what I’m saying Wealthy, appetizing
 The poor gonna be so poor, and hungry
 Right
 You know what I’m saying, it’s gonna be like
 You know what I'm saying, it's gonna be...
 There might, there might be some cannibalism out this muh-fu-
 They might eat the rich, you know what I'm saying?
 Aight so let me ask you this then
 Do you see yourself as somebody that’s rich
 Or somebody that made the best of they own opportunities?
 I see myself as a natural born hustler
 A true hustler in every sense of the word
 I took nothin’, I took the opportunities
 I worked at the most menial and degrading job
 And built myself up so I could get it to where I owned it
 I went from having somebody managing me
 To me hiring the person that works my management company
 I changed everything, I realized my destiny
 In a matter of five years, you know what I’m saying?
 I made myself a millionaire, I made millions for a lot of people
 Now it’s time to make millions for myself, you know what I’m saying?
 I made millions for the record companies
 I made millions for these movie companies
 Now I make millions for, for us
 And through your different avenues of success
 How would you say you managed to keep a level of sanity?
 By my faith in God, by my faith in the game
 And by my faith in ""all good things come to those that stay true""
 Right
 You know what I’m saying?
 And it was happening to me for a reason
 You know what I’m saying, I was noticing, shit
 I was punching the right buttons and it was happening
 So it’s no problem, you know
 I mean, it’s a problem but I’m not finna let them know
 I’m finna go straight through
 Would you consider yourself a fighter at heart or somebody that
 Somebody that only reacts when they back is against the wall?
 Shit, I like to think that at every opportunity I’ve ever been, uh
 Threatened with resistance, it’s been met with resistance
 And not only me but, it goes down my family tree
 You know what I’m saying, it’s in my veins to fight back
 Aight well, how long will you think it take before niggas be like
 ""We fighting a war, I’m fighting a war I can’t win
 And I wanna lay it all down""
 In this country, a black man only have like
 5 years we can exhibit maximum strength
 And that’s right now while you a teenager, while you still strong
 While you still wanna lift weights, while you still wanna shoot back
 'Cause once you turn 30 it’s like
 They take the heart and soul out of a man
 Out of a black man, in this country
 And you don’t wanna fight no more
 And if you don’t believe me, you can look around
 You don’t see no loud mouth 30-year old motherfuckers
 That’s crazy, because me being one of your offsprings
 Of the legacy you left behind, I can truly tell you that
 There’s nothing but turmoil goin’ on so, I wanted to ask you
 What you think is the future for me and my generation today?
 I think that niggas is tired of grabbin' shit out the stores
 And next time it's a riot it's gonna be like, uh, bloodshed
 For real, I don’t think America know that
 I think America think we was just playing
 And it’s gonna be some more playing but
 It ain’t gonna be no playing
 It’s gonna be murder, you know what I’m saying?
 It’s gonna be like Nat Turner, 1831, up in this motherfucker
 You know what I’m saying, it’s gonna happen
 That’s crazy, man, in my opinion
 Only hope that we kinda have left is music and vibrations
 Lot a people don’t understand how important it is, you know
 Sometimes I can like, get behind a mic
 And I don’t know what type of energy I’ma push out
 Or where it comes from, trip me out sometimes
 Because it's spirits, we ain’t even really rappin’
 We just letting our dead homies tell stories for us
 Damn
 I wanted to read one last thing to you
 It’s actually something a good friend had wrote
 Describing my world, it says:
 “The caterpillar is a prisoner to the streets that conceived it
 Its only job is to eat or consume everything around it
 In order to protect itself from this mad city
 While consuming its environment
 The caterpillar begins to notice ways to survive
 One thing it noticed is how much the world shuns him
 But praises the butterfly
 The butterfly represents the talent, the thoughtfulness
 And the beauty within the caterpillar
 But having a harsh outlook on life
 The caterpillar sees the butterfly as weak
 And figures out a way to pimp it to his own benefits
 Already surrounded by this mad city
 The caterpillar goes to work on the cocoon
 Which institutionalizes him
 He can no longer see past his own thoughts
 He’s trapped
 When trapped inside these walls certain ideas take root, such as
 Going home, and bringing back new concepts to this mad city
 The result?
 Wings begin to emerge, breaking the cycle of feeling stagnant
 Finally free, the butterfly sheds light on situations
 That the caterpillar never considered, ending the internal struggle
 Although the butterfly and caterpillar are completely different
 They are one and the same""
 What’s your perspective on that?

BLOOD.,DAMN.,,1,1:58,,Studio,4,14 Apr 17,14,"Is it wickedness?
 Is it weakness?
 You decide
 Are we gonna live or die?
 So I was takin' a walk the other day
 And I seen a woman, a blind woman
 Pacin' up and down the sidewalk
 She seemed to be a bit frustrated
 As if she had dropped somethin' and
 Havin' a hard time findin' it
 So after watchin' her struggle for a while
 I decide to go over and lend a helping hand, you know?
 ""Hello, ma'am, can I be of any assistance?
 It seems to me that you have lost something
 I would like to help you find it""
 She replied, ""Oh, yes, you have lost something
 You've lost, your life""
 [Gunshot]
 Is it wickedness?
 Lamar stated his views on police brutality

DNA.,DAMN.,,2,3:05,,Studio,4,14 Apr 17,14,"I got, I got, I got, I got
 Loyalty, got royalty inside my DNA
 Cocaine quarter piece, got war and peace inside my DNA
 I got power, poison, pain, and joy inside my DNA
 I got hustle, though, ambition flow inside my DNA
 I was born like this, since one like this, immaculate conception
 I transform like this, perform like this, was Yeshua new weapon
 I don't contemplate, I meditate, then off your fucking head
 This that put-the-kids-to-bed
 This that I got, I got, I got, I got
 Realness, I just kill shit ’cause it's in my DNA
 I got millions, I got riches buildin' in my DNA
 I got dark, I got evil that rot inside my DNA
 I got off, I got troublesome heart inside my DNA
 I just win again, then win again like Wimbledon, I serve
 Yeah, that’s him again, the sound that engine in is like a bird
 You see fireworks and Corvette tire skrrt the boulevard
 I know how you work, I know just who you are
 See, you's a, you's a, you's a
 Bitch, your hormones prolly switch inside your DNA
 Problem is, all that sucker shit inside your DNA
 Daddy prolly snitched, heritage inside your DNA
 Backbone don't exist, born outside a jellyfish, I gauge
 See, my pedigree most definitely don't tolerate the front
 Shit I've been through prolly offend you, this is Paula's oldest son
 I know murder, conviction
 Burners, boosters, burglars, ballers, dead, redemption
 Scholars, fathers dead with kids and
 I wish I was fed forgiveness
 Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, soldier’s DNA (I’m a soldier's DNA)
 Born inside the beast, my expertise checked out in second grade
 When I was 9, on cell, motel, we didn’t have nowhere to stay
 At 29, I've done so well, hit cartwheel in my estate
 And I'm gon' shine like I’m supposed to, antisocial extrovert
 And excellent mean the extra work
 And absentness what the fuck you heard
 And pessimists never struck my nerve
 And Nazareth gonna plead his case
 The reason my power's here on earth
 Salute the truth, when the prophet say
 I-I got loyalty, got royalty inside my DNA
 This is why I say that hip hop has done more damage to young African Americans than racism in recent years
 I-I got loyalty, got royalty inside my DNA
 I live a better life, I'm rollin' several dice, fuck your life
 I-I got loyalty, got royalty inside my DNA
 I live a be-, fuck your life
 5, 4, 3, 2, 1
 This is my heritage, all I'm inheritin'
 Money and power, the mecca of marriages
 Tell me somethin'
 You mothafuckas can't tell me nothin'
 I'd rather die than to listen to you
 My DNA not for imitation
 Your DNA an abomination
 This how it is when you in the Matrix
 Dodgin' bullets, reapin' what you sow
 And stackin' up the footage, livin' on the go
 And sleepin' in a villa
 Sippin' from a Grammy, walkin' in the buildin'
 Diamond in the ceilin', marble on the floors
 Beach inside the window, peekin' out the window
 Baby in the pool, godfather goals
 Only Lord knows I've been goin' hammer
 Dodgin' paparazzi, freakin' through the cameras
 Eat at Four Daughters, Brock wearin' sandals
 Yoga on a Monday, stretchin' to Nirvana
 Watchin' all the snakes, curvin' all the fakes
 Phone never on, I don't conversate
 I don't compromise, I just penetrate
 Sex, money, murder, these are the breaks
 These are the times, level number 9
 Look up in the sky, 10 is on the way
 Sentence on the way, killings on the way
 Motherfucker, I got winners on the way
 You ain't shit without a body on your belt
 You ain't shit without a ticket on your plate
 You ain't sick enough to pull it on yourself
 You ain't rich enough to hit the lot and skate
 Tell me when destruction gonna be my fate
 Gonna be your fate, gonna be our faith
 Peace to the world, let it rotate

 My daddy commissary made it to commas
 Bitch, all my grandmas dead
 So ain't nobody prayin' for me, I'm on your head, ayy
 Thirty millions later, know the feds watchin'
 Auntie on my Telegram like, ""Be cautious!""

 I don't do it for the 'Gram, I do it for Compton
 I'm willin' to die for this shit, nigga
 I'll take your fuckin' life for this shit, nigga
 We ain't goin' back to broke, family sellin' dope
 That's why you maney-ass rap niggas better know
 If I gotta slap a pussy-ass nigga, I'ma make it look sexy
 If I gotta go hard on a bitch, I'ma make it look sexy
 I pull up, hop out, air out, made it look sexy
 They won't take me out my element

 Relocate, jump on the same G5
 Checkin' for me heavy 'cause I go, yeah, I go, yeah

 Niggas thought that K-Dot real life
 Was the same life they see on TV, huh?
 Niggas wanna flex on me and be in L.A. for free, huh?
 Next time they hit the 10 freeway, we need a receipt, huh?
 'Cause most of y'all ain't real, most of y'all gon' squeal
 Most of y'all just envy, but jealousy get you killed
 Most of y'all throw rocks and try to hide your hand

 Because it's all in your eyes, most of y'all tell lies
 Most of y'all don't fade, most of y'all been advised

 I feel like you may be the problem

 The world is endin', I'm done pretendin'
 And fuck you if you get offended

 I feel like the family been fakin'

 Feel like my thought of compromise is jaded
 Feel like you wanna scrutinize how I made it

 I feel like the enemy you should know
 Feel like the feelin' of no hope
 The feelin' of bad dope
 A quarter ounce manipulated from soap
 The feelin', the feelin' of false freedom
 I'll force-feed 'em the poison that fill 'em up in the prison
 I feel like it's just me
 Look, I feel like I can't breathe
 Look, I feel like I can't sleep
 Look, I feel heartless, often off this
 Feelin' of fallin', of fallin' apart with
 Darkest hours, lost it
 Fillin' the void of bein' employed with ballin'
 Streets is talkin', fill in the blanks with coffins
 Fill up the banks with dollars
 Fill up the graves with fathers
 Fill up the babies with bullshit
 Internet blogs and pulpit, fill 'em with gossip
 I feel like this gotta be the feelin' where 'Pac was
 The feelin' of an apocalypse happenin'
 But nothin' is awkward, the feelin' won't prosper
 The feelin' is toxic, I feel like I'm boxin' demons
 Monsters, false prophets schemin'
 Sponsors, industry promises
 Niggas, bitches, honkies, crackers, Compton
 Church, religion, token blacks in bondage
 Lawsuit visits, subpoena served in concert
 Fuck your feelings, I mean this for imposters
 I can feel it, the phoenix sure to watch us
 I can feel it, the dream is more than process
 I can put a regime that forms a Loch Ness
 I can feel it, the scream that haunts all logic
 I feel like sayin' somethin', I feel like takin' somethin'
 I feel like skatin' off, I feel like waitin' for 'em
 Maybe it's too late for 'em

 Is it unconditional when the 'Rari don't start?
 Tell me when your loyalty is comin' from the heart
 Tell me who you loyal to
 Do it start with your woman or your man? (Mmm)
 Do it end with your family and friends? (Mmm)

PRIDE.,DAMN.,,7,4:35,,Studio,4,14 Apr 17,14,"Love's gonna get you killed
 But pride’s gonna be the death of you and you and me
 And you and you and you and me
 And you and you and you and me
 And you and you and you and me and
 Me, I wasn't taught to share, but care
 In another life, I surely was there
 Me, I wasn't taught to share, but care
 I care, I care
 Hell-raising, wheel-chasing, new worldly possessions
 Flesh-making, spirit-breaking, which one would you lessen?
 The better part, the human heart, you love ’em or dissect 'em
 Happiness or flashiness? How do you serve the question?
 See, in a perfect world, I would be perfect, world
 I don't trust people enough beyond they surface, world
 I don't love people enough to put my faith in man
 I put my faith in these lyrics, hoping I make a band
 I understand I ain't perfect, I probably won't come around
 This time I might put you down
 Last time I ain't give a fuck, I still feel the same now
 My feelings might go numb, you're dealing with cold thumb
 I’m willing to give up a leg and arm to show empathy from
 Pity parties and functions of you and yours
 A perfect world, you probably live another 24
 I can’t fake humble just 'cause your ass is insecure
 I can’t fake humble just 'cause your ass is insecure
 Me, I wasn't taught to share, but care
 In another life, I surely was there
 Me, I wasn't taught to share, but care
 I care, I care
 Maybe I wasn’t there (We saw you first)
 Maybe I wasn't there (I saw you first)
 Maybe I wasn't there (I saw you first)
 Maybe I wasn't there
 Now, in a perfect world, I probably won't be insensitive
 Cold as December but never remember what winter did
 I wouldn't blame you for mistakes I made or the bed I laid
 Seems like I point the finger just to make a point nowadays
 Smiles and cold stares, the temperature goes there
 Indigenous disposition, feel like we belong here
 I know the walls, they can listen, I wish they could talk back
 The hurt becomes repetition, the love almost lost that
 Sick venom in men and women overcome with pride
 A perfect world is never perfect, only filled with lies
 Promises are broken and more resentment come alive
 Race barriers make inferior of you and I
 See, in a perfect world, I'll choose faith over riches
 I'll choose work over bitches, I'll make schools out of prison
 I'll take all the religions and put 'em all in one service
 Just to tell 'em we ain't shit, but He's been perfect, world
 Me, I wasn't taught to share, but care
 In another life, I surely was there
 Me, I wasn't taught to share, but care
 I care, I care
 Maybe I wasn't there (We saw you first)

HUMBLE.,DAMN.,,8,2:57,,Studio,4,14 Apr 17,14,"Nobody pray for me
 It been that day for me
 Way (Yeah, yeah)
 Ayy, I remember syrup sandwiches and crime allowances
 Finesse a nigga with some counterfeits, but now I'm countin’ this
 Parmesan where my accountant lives, in fact I'm downin' this
 D’USSÉ with my boo bae tastes like Kool-Aid for the analysts
 Girl, I can buy your ass the world with my paystub
 Ooh, that pussy good, won't you sit it on my taste bloods?
 I get way too petty once you let me do the extras
 Pull up on your block, then break it down: we playin' Tetris
 AM to the PM, PM to the AM, funk
 Piss out your per diem, you just gotta hate 'em, funk
 If I quit your BM, I still ride Mercedes, funk
 If I quit this season, I still be the greatest, funk
 My left stroke just went viral
 Right stroke put lil' baby in a spiral

 It's levels to it, you and I know

 Get the fuck off my dick, that ain't right
 I make a play fucking up your whole life
 I'm so fuckin' sick and tired of the Photoshop
 Show me somethin' natural like afro on Richard Pryor
 Show me somethin' natural like ass with some stretch marks
 Still will take you down right on your mama's couch in Polo socks
 Ayy, this shit way too crazy, ayy, you do not amaze me, ayy

 Way too hot to simmer down, might as well overheat

 Ooh, I don't want more than that; girl, I respect the cat

 Go hit you a lick, go fuck on a bitch

 Wake up in the morning, thinking 'bout money, kick your feet up
 Hop in the shower, put on your makeup, lace your weave up
 Touch on yourself, call up your nigga, tell him he ain't shit
 Credit card scam, get you a Visa, make it pay your rent
 Hop on the 'gram, flex on the bitches that be hatin' on you

 I wake in the morning, my head spinning from the last night
 Both in a trance, feelings are dead—what a fast life
 Manager called, the lobby call is 11:30
 Did this before, promised myself I'd be a hour early
 Room full of clothes, bag full of money: call it loose change
 Fumbled my jewelry, 100K, I lost a new chain
 Hop on the bird, hit the next city for another M
 Take me a nap then do it again
 We all woke up, tryna tune to the daily news
 Looking for confirmation, hoping election wasn't true
 All of us worried, all of us buried, in our feelings deep
 None of us married to his proposal, make us feel cheap
 Stale and sad, distraught and mad, tell the neighbor 'bout it—
 Bet they agree, parade the streets with your voice proudly
 Time passing, things change
 Reverting back to our daily programs, stuck in our ways
 Lust
 Lately, I feel like I been lusting over the fame
 Lately, we lust on the same routine of shame
 Lately (Lately) Lately, my lust been heightened (Lately)
 Lately, it's all contradiction (Lately, I'm not here)
 Lately, I lust over self (Lust turn into fear)
 Lately, in James 4:4 says
 ""Friend of the world is enemy of the Lord""
 Brace yourself: Lust is all yours

 Yesterday, I got a call, like, from my dog, like 101
 Said they killed his only son because of insufficient funds
 He was sobbin', he was mobbin', way belligerent and drunk
 Talkin' out his head, philosophin' on what the Lord had done
 He said: ""K-Dot, can you pray for me? It been a fucked up day for me
 I know that you anointed, show me how to overcome.""
 He was lookin' for some closure, hopin' I could bring him closer
 To the spiritual, my spirit do know better, but I told him
 ""I can't sugarcoat the answer for you, this is how I feel:
 If somebody kill my son, that mean somebody gettin' killed.""
 Tell me what you do for love, loyalty, and passion of
 All the memories collected, moments you could never touch
 I wait in front a nigga's spot and watch him hit his block
 I catch a nigga leavin' service if that's all I got
 I chip a nigga, then throw the blower in his lap

 I can't even keep the peace, don't you fuck with one of ours

 Compulsive disorder, sons and daughters
 Barricaded blocks and borders—look what you taught us
 It's murder on my street, your street, back streets, Wall Street
 Corporate offices, banks, employees, and bosses with
 Homicidal thoughts; Donald Trump's in office
 We lost Barack and promised to never doubt him again
 But is America honest, or do we bask in sin?
 Pass the gin, I mix it with American blood
 Then bash him in, you Crippin' or you married to Blood?
 I'll aks again, oops, accident
 It's nasty when you set us up then roll the dice, then bet us up
 You overnight the big rifles, then tell Fox to be scared of us

 Now
 When I was 27, I grew accustomed to more fear
 Accumulated 10 times over throughout the years
 My newfound life made all of me magnified
 How many accolades do I need to block denial?
 The shock value of my success put bolts in me
 All this money, is God playin' a joke on me?
 Is it for the moment, and will he see me as Job?
 Take it from me and leave me worse than I was before?
 At 27, my biggest fear was losin' it all
 Scared to spend money, had me sleepin' from hall to hall
 Scared to go back to Section 8 with my mama stressin'
 30 shows a month and I still won't buy me no Lexus
 What is an advisor? Somebody that's holdin' my checks
 Just to fuck me over and put my finances in debt?
 I read a case about Rihanna's accountant and wondered
 How did the Bad Girl feel when she looked at them numbers?
 The type of shit'll make me flip out and just kill somethin'
 Drill somethin', get ill and fill ratchets with a lil' somethin'
 I practiced runnin' from fear, guess I had some good luck
 At 27 years old, my biggest fear was bein' judged
 How they look at me reflect on myself, my family, my city
 What they say 'bout me reveal if my reputation would miss me
 What they see from me would trickle down generations in time
 What they hear from me would make 'em highlight my simplest lines
 I'm talkin' fear, fear of losin' creativity
 I'm talkin' fear, fear of missin' out on you and me
 I'm talkin' fear, fear of losin' loyalty from pride
 'Cause my DNA won't let me involve in the light of God
 I'm talkin' fear, fear that my humbleness is gone
 I'm talkin' fear, fear that love ain't livin' here no more
 I'm talkin' fear, fear that it's wickedness or weakness
 Fear, whatever it is, both is distinctive
 Fear, what happens on Earth stays on Earth
 And I can't take these feelings with me, so hopefully, they disperse
 Within 14 tracks, carried out over wax
 Searchin' for resolutions until somebody get back
 Fear, what happens on Earth stays on Earth
 And I can't take these feelings with me, so hopefully they disperse
 Within 14 tracks, carried out over wax
 Wonderin' if I'm livin' through fear or livin' through rap
 Damn
 God damn you, God damn me
 God damn us, God damn we
 God damn us all
 Verse 2 says, ""You only have I known of all the families of the Earth, therefore I will punish you for all your iniquities""
 So until we come back to these commandments
 Until you come back to these commandments
 We gonna feel this way, we gonna be under this curse
 Because He said He's gonna punish us
 The so-called Blacks, Hispanics, and Native American Indians
 Are the true children of Israel
 We are the Israelites, according to the Bible
 The children of Israel
 He's gonna punish us for our iniquities, for our disobedience
 Because we chose to follow other gods
 That man chastens his son, so the Lord, thy God, chasten thee
 So, just like you chasten your own son, He's gonna chasten you
 Because He loves you, so that's why we get chastised
 That's why we're in the position that we're in
 Until we come back to these laws, statutes, and commandments
 And do what the Lord says, these curses is gonna be upon us
 We gonna be at a lower state in this life that we live
 Here, in today, in the United States of America
 I love you, family, and I pray for you
 God bless you

DUCKWORTH.,DAMN.,,14,4:08,,Studio,4,14 Apr 17,14,"It was always me versus the world
 Until I found it's me versus me
 Why, why, why, why?
 Why, why, why, why?
 Just remember, what happens on Earth stays on Earth!
 We gon' put it in reverse
 Darling, I told you many times
 And I am telling you once again
 Just to remind you, sweetheart
 That my
 Oh, Lamar
 Hail Mary and marijuana, times is hard
 Pray with the hooligans, shadows all in the dark
 Fellowship with demons and relatives, I'm a star
 Life is one funny ma'fucker
 A true comedian, you gotta love him, you gotta trust him
 I might be buggin', infomercials and no sleep
 Introverted by my thoughts; children, listen, it gets deep
 See, once upon a time inside the Nickerson Garden projects
 The object was to process and digest poverty's dialect
 Adaptation inevitable: gun violence, crack spot
 Federal policies raid buildings and drug professionals
 Anthony was the oldest of seven
 Well-respected, calm and collected
 Laughin' and jokin' made life easier; hard times, mama on crack
 A four-year-old tellin' his nanny he needed her
 His family history: pimpin' and bangin'
 He was meant to be dangerous, clocked him a grip and start slangin'
 Fifteen, scrapin' up his jeans with quarter pieces
 Even got some head from a smoker last weekend
 Dodged a policeman, workin' for his big homie
 Small-time hustler, graduated to a brick on him
 Ten-thousand dollars out of a project housing, that's on the daily
 Seen his first mill' twenty years old, had a couple of babies
 Had a couple of shooters, caught a murder case
 Fingerprints on the gun they assumin', but witnesses couldn't prove it
 That was back when he turned his back and they killed his cousin
 He beat the case and went back to hustlin'
 Bird-shufflin', Anthony rang
 The first in the projects with the two-tone Mustang, that 5.0 thing They say 5-0 came, circlin' parking lots and parking spots
 And hoppin' out while harrassin' the corner blocks
 Crooked cops told Anthony he should kick it
 He brushed 'em off and walked back to the Kentucky Fried Chicken
 See, at this chicken spot, there was a light-skinned nigga that talked a lot
 With a curly top and a gap in his teeth, he worked the window
 His name was Ducky, he came from the streets, The Robert Taylor Homes
 Southside Projects, Chiraq, the Terror Dome
 Drove to California with a woman on him and five-hundred dollars
 They had a son, hopin' that he'd see college
 Hustlin' on the side with a nine-to-five to freak it
 Cadillac Seville, he'd ride his son around on weekends
 Three-piece special with his name on the shirt pocket
 'Cross the street from the projects, Anthony planned to rob it
 Stuck up the place before, back in '84
 That's when affiliation was really at gears of war
 So many relatives tellin' us, sellin' us devilish works, killin' us, crime
 Intelligent, felonious prevalent proposition with 9s
 Ducky was well-aware
 They robbed the manager and shot a customer last year
 He figured he'd get on these niggas' good sides
 Free chicken every time Anthony posted in line, two extra biscuits
 Anthony liked him and then let him slide, they didn't kill him
 In fact, it look like they're the last to survive, pay attention
 That one decision changed both of they lives, one curse at a time
 Reverse the manifest and good karma, and I'll tell you why
 You take two strangers and put 'em in random predicaments
 Give 'em a soul, so they can make their own choices and live with it
 Twenty years later, them same strangers, you make 'em meet again
 Inside recording studios where they reapin' their benefits
 Then you start remindin' them about that chicken incident
 Whoever thought the greatest rapper would be from coincidence?
 Because if Anthony killed Ducky, Top Dawg could be servin' life
 While I grew up without a father and die in a gunfight

 I don’t think I could find a way to make it on this earth
 (I've been hungry all my life)
 What's up, family?
 Yeah, it’s your cousin Carl, man, just givin' you a call, man
 I know you been havin' a lot on yo' mind lately
 And I know you feel like, you know
 People ain't been prayin' for you
 But you have to understand this, man, that we are a cursed people Deuteronomy 28:28 says,
 ""The Lord shall smite thee with madness And blindness, and astonishment of heart""
 See, family, that's why you feel like you feel
 Like you got a chip on your shoulder
 Until you follow His commandments, you gonna feel that way
 Why God, why God do I gotta suffer?
 Pain in my heart carry burdens full of struggle
 Why God, why God do I gotta bleed?
 Every stone thrown at you restin' at my feet

 I beat yo' ass if you jump on my couch
 I beat yo' ass if you walk in this house
 With tears in your eyes, runnin' from Poo Poo and Prentice
 Go back outside, I beat yo' ass, lil' nigga
 That homework better be finished, I beat yo' ass
 Your teachers better not be bitchin' 'bout you in class
 That pizza better not be wasted, you eat it all
 That TV better not be loud if you got it on
 Them Jordans better not get dirty when I just bought 'em
 Better not hear 'bout you humpin' on Keisha's daughter
 Better not hear you got caught up
 I beat yo' ass, you better not run to your father
 I beat yo' ass, you know my patience runnin' thin
 I got buku payments to make
 County building's on my ass, tryna take my food stamps away
 I beat yo' ass if you tell them social workers he live here
 I beat yo' ass if I beat yo' ass twice and you still here
 Seven years old, think you run this house by yourself?

 I'll prolly die because I ain't know Demarcus was snitchin'
 I'll prolly die at these house parties, fuckin' with bitches
 I'll prolly die from witnesses leavin' me falsed accused
 I'll prolly die from thinkin' that me and your hood was cool

 Or maybe die because these smokers are more than desperate
 I'll prolly die from one of these bats and blue badges
 Body-slammed on black and white paint, my bones snappin'
 Or maybe die from panic or die from bein' too lax
 Or die from waitin' on it, die 'cause I'm movin' too fast
 I'll prolly die tryna buy weed at the apartments
 I'll prolly die tryna defuse two homies arguin'
 I'll prolly die 'cause that's what you do when you're 17
 All worries in a hurry, I wish I controlled things
 If I could smoke fear away, I'd roll that mothafucker up
 And then I'd take two puffs
 (I've been hungry all my life)
 I'm high now (Huh), I'm high now (Huh)
 I'm high now (Huh), I'm high now (Huh)
 Life's a bitch, pull them panties to the side now
 (Pull them panties to the side now)
 Now
 When I was 27, I grew accustomed to more fear
 Accumulated 10 times over throughout the years
 My newfound life made all of me magnified
 How many accolades do I need to block denial?
 The shock value of my success put bolts in me
 All this money, is God playin' a joke on me?
 Is it for the moment, and will he see me as Job?
 Take it from me and leave me worse than I was before?
 At 27, my biggest fear was losin' it all
 Scared to spend money, had me sleepin' from hall to hall
 Scared to go back to Section 8 with my mama stressin'
 30 shows a month and I still won't buy me no Lexus
 What is an advisor? Somebody that's holdin' my checks
 Just to fuck me over and put my finances in debt?
 I read a case about Rihanna's accountant and wondered
 How did the Bad Girl feel when she looked at them numbers?
 The type of shit'll make me flip out and just kill somethin'
 Drill somethin', get ill and fill ratchets with a lil' somethin'
 I practiced runnin' from fear, guess I had some good luck
 At 27 years old, my biggest fear was bein' judged
 How they look at me reflect on myself, my family, my city
 What they say 'bout me reveal if my reputation would miss me
 What they see from me would trickle down generations in time
 What they hear from me would make 'em highlight my simplest lines
 I'm talkin' fear, fear of losin' creativity
 I'm talkin' fear, fear of missin' out on you and me
 I'm talkin' fear, fear of losin' loyalty from pride
 'Cause my DNA won't let me involve in the light of God
 I'm talkin' fear, fear that my humbleness is gone
 I'm talkin' fear, fear that love ain't livin' here no more
 I'm talkin' fear, fear that it's wickedness or weakness
 Fear, whatever it is, both is distinctive
 Fear, what happens on Earth stays on Earth
 And I can't take these feelings with me, so hopefully, they disperse
 Within 14 tracks, carried out over wax
 Searchin' for resolutions until somebody get back
 Fear, what happens on Earth stays on Earth
 And I can't take these feelings with me, so hopefully they disperse
 Within 14 tracks, carried out over wax
 Wonderin' if I'm livin' through fear or livin' through rap
 Damn
 God damn you, God damn me
 God damn us, God damn we
 God damn us all
 Verse 2 says, ""You only have I known of all the families of the Earth, therefore I will punish you for all your iniquities""
 So until we come back to these commandments
 Until you come back to these commandments
 We gonna feel this way, we gonna be under this curse
 Because He said He's gonna punish us
 The so-called Blacks, Hispanics, and Native American Indians
 Are the true children of Israel
 We are the Israelites, according to the Bible
 The children of Israel
 He's gonna punish us for our iniquities, for our disobedience
 Because we chose to follow other gods
 That man chastens his son, so the Lord, thy God, chasten thee
 So, just like you chasten your own son, He's gonna chasten you
 Because He loves you, so that's why we get chastised
 That's why we're in the position that we're in
 Until we come back to these laws, statutes, and commandments
 And do what the Lord says, these curses is gonna be upon us
 We gonna be at a lower state in this life that we live
 Here, in today, in the United States of America
 I love you, family, and I pray for you
 God bless you

 Johnny caught a body yesterday out hustlin'
 God bless America, you know we all love him
 Yesterday, I got a call, like, from my dog, like 101
 Said they killed his only son because of insufficient funds
 He was sobbin', he was mobbin', way belligerent and drunk
 Talkin' out his head, philosophin' on what the Lord had done
 He said: ""K-Dot, can you pray for me? It been a fucked up day for me
 I know that you anointed, show me how to overcome.""
 He was lookin' for some closure, hopin' I could bring him closer
 To the spiritual, my spirit do know better, but I told him
 ""I can't sugarcoat the answer for you, this is how I feel:
 If somebody kill my son, that mean somebody gettin' killed.""
 Tell me what you do for love, loyalty, and passion of
 All the memories collected, moments you could never touch
 I wait in front a nigga's spot and watch him hit his block
 I catch a nigga leavin' service if that's all I got
 I chip a nigga, then throw the blower in his lap
 Walk myself to the court like, ""Bitch, I did that!""
 Ain't no Black Power when your baby killed by a coward
 I can't even keep the peace, don't you fuck with one of ours
 It be murder in the street, it be bodies in the hour
 Ghetto bird be on the street, paramedics on the dial
 Let somebody touch my momma, touch my sister, touch my woman
 Touch my daddy, touch my niece, touch my nephew, touch my brother
 You should chip a nigga, then throw the blower in his lap
 Matter fact, I'm 'bout to speak at this convention, call you back
 Alright, kids, we're gonna talk about gun control

 Of drum and bass
 You close your eyes to look around

 Compulsive disorder, sons and daughters
 Barricaded blocks and borders—look what you taught us
 It's murder on my street, your street, back streets, Wall Street
 Corporate offices, banks, employees, and bosses with
 Homicidal thoughts; Donald Trump's in office
 We lost Barack and promised to never doubt him again
 But is America honest, or do we bask in sin?
 Pass the gin, I mix it with American blood
 Then bash him in, you Crippin' or you married to Blood?
 I'll aks again, oops, accident
 It's nasty when you set us up then roll the dice, then bet us up
 You overnight the big rifles, then tell Fox to be scared of us

 Ooh, I don't want more than that; girl, I respect the cat
 I promise, just a touch

 Rush the fire exit, no time for battles
 Well I, I never expected

 This that new, new shit

 Watch you a comedy, take a shit, then roll some weed up
 Go hit you a lick, go fuck on a bitch
 Don't go to work today, cop you a fit

 Hop in the shower, put on your makeup, lace your weave up
 Touch on yourself, call up your nigga, tell him he ain't shit
 Credit card scam, get you a Visa, make it pay your rent
 Hop on the 'gram, flex on the bitches that be hatin' on you

 Both in a trance, feelings are dead—what a fast life
 Manager called, the lobby call is 11:30
 Did this before, promised myself I'd be a hour early
 Room full of clothes, bag full of money: call it loose change
 Fumbled my jewelry, 100K, I lost a new chain
 Hop on the bird, hit the next city for another M
 Take me a nap then do it again
 We all woke up, tryna tune to the daily news
 Looking for confirmation, hoping election wasn't true
 All of us worried, all of us buried, in our feelings deep
 None of us married to his proposal, make us feel cheap
 Stale and sad, distraught and mad, tell the neighbor 'bout it—
 Bet they agree, parade the streets with your voice proudly
 Time passing, things change
 Reverting back to our daily programs, stuck in our ways
 Lust
 Lately, I feel like I been lusting over the fame
 Lately, we lust on the same routine of shame
 Lately (Lately) Lately, my lust been heightened (Lately)
 Lately, it's all contradiction (Lately, I'm not here)
 Lately, I lust over self (Lust turn into fear)
 Lately, in James 4:4 says
 ""Friend of the world is enemy of the Lord""
 Brace yourself: Lust is all yours

 But pride’s gonna be the death of you and you and me
 And you and you and you and me
 And you and you and you and me
 And you and you and you and me and
 Me, I wasn't taught to share, but care
 In another life, I surely was there
 Me, I wasn't taught to share, but care
 I care, I care
 Hell-raising, wheel-chasing, new worldly possessions
 Flesh-making, spirit-breaking, which one would you lessen?
 The better part, the human heart, you love ’em or dissect 'em
 Happiness or flashiness? How do you serve the question?
 See, in a perfect world, I would be perfect, world
 I don't trust people enough beyond they surface, world
 I don't love people enough to put my faith in man
 I put my faith in these lyrics, hoping I make a band
 I understand I ain't perfect, I probably won't come around
 This time I might put you down
 Last time I ain't give a fuck, I still feel the same now
 My feelings might go numb, you're dealing with cold thumb
 I’m willing to give up a leg and arm to show empathy from
 Pity parties and functions of you and yours
 A perfect world, you probably live another 24
 I can’t fake humble just 'cause your ass is insecure
 I can’t fake humble just 'cause your ass is insecure
 Me, I wasn't taught to share, but care
 In another life, I surely was there
 Me, I wasn't taught to share, but care
 I care, I care
 Maybe I wasn’t there (We saw you first)
 Maybe I wasn't there (I saw you first)
 Maybe I wasn't there (I saw you first)
 Maybe I wasn't there
 Now, in a perfect world, I probably won't be insensitive
 Cold as December but never remember what winter did
 I wouldn't blame you for mistakes I made or the bed I laid
 Seems like I point the finger just to make a point nowadays
 Smiles and cold stares, the temperature goes there
 Indigenous disposition, feel like we belong here
 I know the walls, they can listen, I wish they could talk back
 The hurt becomes repetition, the love almost lost that
 Sick venom in men and women overcome with pride
 A perfect world is never perfect, only filled with lies
 Promises are broken and more resentment come alive
 Race barriers make inferior of you and I
 See, in a perfect world, I'll choose faith over riches
 I'll choose work over bitches, I'll make schools out of prison
 I'll take all the religions and put 'em all in one service
 Just to tell 'em we ain't shit, but He's been perfect, world
 Me, I wasn't taught to share, but care
 In another life, I surely was there
 Me, I wasn't taught to share, but care
 I care, I care
 Maybe I wasn't there (We saw you first)
 Maybe I wasn't there (I saw you first)

 My resume is real enough for two millennium
 A better way to make a wave, stop defendin' them
 I meditate and moderate all of my wins again
 I'm hangin' on the fence again
 I'm always on your mind
 I put my lyric and my lifeline on the line
 And ain't no limit when I might shine, might grind
 You rollin' with it at the right time, right now
 (Only for the dollar sign)
 Bad girl RiRi now
 Swerve, swerve, swerve, swerve, leave it now
 On your pulse like it’s EDM
 Gas in the bitch like it’s premium
 Haul ass on a bitch all in the fast lane
 Been a bad bitch way before any cash came

 I'm a savage, I'm a asshole, I’m a king

 Tell me who you loyal to
 Is it money? Is it fame? Is it weed? Is it drink?
 Is it comin' down with the loud pipes in the rain?
 Big chillin', only for the power in your name
 Tell me who you loyal to
 Is it love for the streets when the lights get dark?
 Is it unconditional when the 'Rari don't start?
 Tell me when your loyalty is comin' from the heart
 Tell me who you loyal to
 Do it start with your woman or your man? (Mmm)
 Do it end with your family and friends? (Mmm)
 Are you loyal to yourself in advance?
 I said, tell me who you loyal to
 Is it anybody that you would lie for?
 Anybody you would slide for?

 I feel like a chip on my shoulders
 I feel like I'm losin' my focus
 I feel like I'm losin' my patience
 I feel like my thoughts in the basement
 Feel like, I feel like you're miseducated
 Feel like I don't wanna be bothered
 I feel like you may be the problem
 I feel like it ain't no tomorrow, fuck the world
 The world is endin', I'm done pretendin'
 And fuck you if you get offended
 I feel like friends been overrated
 I feel like the family been fakin'
 I feel like the feelings are changin'
 Feel like my thought of compromise is jaded
 Feel like you wanna scrutinize how I made it
 Feel like I ain't feelin' you all
 Feel like removin' myself, no feelings involved
 I feel for you, I've been in the field for you

 I feel niggas tappin' they pockets

 I am legend, I feel like all of y'all is peasants
 I feel like all of y'all is desperate
 I feel like all it take is a second to feel like
 Mike Jordan whenever holdin' a real mic
 I ain't feelin' your presence
 Feel like I'ma learn you a lesson
 Feel like only me and the music though
 I feel like your feelin' ain't mutual
 I feel like the enemy you should know
 Feel like the feelin' of no hope
 The feelin' of bad dope
 A quarter ounce manipulated from soap
 The feelin', the feelin' of false freedom
 I'll force-feed 'em the poison that fill 'em up in the prison
 I feel like it's just me
 Look, I feel like I can't breathe
 Look, I feel like I can't sleep
 Look, I feel heartless, often off this
 Feelin' of fallin', of fallin' apart with
 Darkest hours, lost it
 Fillin' the void of bein' employed with ballin'
 Streets is talkin', fill in the blanks with coffins
 Fill up the banks with dollars
 Fill up the graves with fathers
 Fill up the babies with bullshit
 Internet blogs and pulpit, fill 'em with gossip
 I feel like this gotta be the feelin' where 'Pac was
 The feelin' of an apocalypse happenin'
 But nothin' is awkward, the feelin' won't prosper
 The feelin' is toxic, I feel like I'm boxin' demons
 Monsters, false prophets schemin'
 Sponsors, industry promises
 Niggas, bitches, honkies, crackers, Compton
 Church, religion, token blacks in bondage
 Lawsuit visits, subpoena served in concert
 Fuck your feelings, I mean this for imposters
 I can feel it, the phoenix sure to watch us
 I can feel it, the dream is more than process
 I can put a regime that forms a Loch Ness
 I can feel it, the scream that haunts all logic
 I feel like sayin' somethin', I feel like takin' somethin'
 I feel like skatin' off, I feel like waitin' for 'em
 Maybe it's too late for 'em
 I feel like the whole world want me to pray for 'em
 But who the fuck prayin' for me?

 Niggas wanna flex on me and be in L.A. for free, huh?
 Next time they hit the 10 freeway, we need a receipt, huh?
 'Cause most of y'all ain't real, most of y'all gon' squeal
 Most of y'all just envy, but jealousy get you killed
 Most of y'all throw rocks and try to hide your hand

 Because it's all in your eyes, most of y'all tell lies
 Most of y'all don't fade, most of y'all been advised

 I got power, poison, pain, and joy inside my DNA
 I got hustle, though, ambition flow inside my DNA

 I transform like this, perform like this, was Yeshua new weapon
 I don't contemplate, I meditate, then off your fucking head
 This that put-the-kids-to-bed

 I got dark, I got evil that rot inside my DNA
 I got off, I got troublesome heart inside my DNA

 Bitch, your hormones prolly switch inside your DNA
 Problem is, all that sucker shit inside your DNA
 Daddy prolly snitched, heritage inside your DNA
 Backbone don't exist, born outside a jellyfish, I gauge
 See, my pedigree most definitely don't tolerate the front
 Shit I've been through prolly offend you, this is Paula's oldest son

 And I'm gon' shine like I’m supposed to, antisocial extrovert
 And excellent mean the extra work
 And absentness what the fuck you heard
 And pessimists never struck my nerve
 And Nazareth gonna plead his case
 The reason my power's here on earth
 Salute the truth, when the prophet say
 I-I got loyalty, got royalty inside my DNA
 This is why I say that hip hop has done more damage to young African Americans than racism in recent years
 I-I got loyalty, got royalty inside my DNA
 I live a better life, I'm rollin' several dice, fuck your life
 I-I got loyalty, got royalty inside my DNA
 I live a be-, fuck your life

 Your DNA an abomination
 This how it is when you in the Matrix
 Dodgin' bullets, reapin' what you sow
 And stackin' up the footage, livin' on the go
 And sleepin' in a villa
 Sippin' from a Grammy, walkin' in the buildin'
 Diamond in the ceilin', marble on the floors
 Beach inside the window, peekin' out the window
 Baby in the pool, godfather goals
 Only Lord knows I've been goin' hammer
 Dodgin' paparazzi, freakin' through the cameras
 Eat at Four Daughters, Brock wearin' sandals
 Yoga on a Monday, stretchin' to Nirvana
 Watchin' all the snakes, curvin' all the fakes
 Phone never on, I don't conversate
 I don't compromise, I just penetrate

 These are the times, level number 9
 Look up in the sky, 10 is on the way
 Sentence on the way, killings on the way
 Motherfucker, I got winners on the way

 You ain't shit without a ticket on your plate
 You ain't sick enough to pull it on yourself

BLOOD.,DAMN. COLLECTORS EDITION.,,14,1:58,,Studio (Reissue),4,8 Dec 17,14,"Is it wickedness?
 Is it weakness?
 You decide
 Are we gonna live or die?
 So I was takin' a walk the other day
 And I seen a woman, a blind woman
 Pacin' up and down the sidewalk
 She seemed to be a bit frustrated
 As if she had dropped somethin' and
 Havin' a hard time findin' it
 So after watchin' her struggle for a while
 I decide to go over and lend a helping hand, you know?
 ""Hello, ma'am, can I be of any assistance?
 It seems to me that you have lost something
 I would like to help you find it""
 She replied, ""Oh, yes, you have lost something
 You've lost, your life""
 [Gunshot]
 Is it wickedness?
 Lamar stated his views on police brutality

 Oh, you want me to touch you right there?
 Oh, like a little lamb, play in your hair
 Oh you want it? Oh you want it right now
 Like that? I got you baby
 All on you baby
 Push it back on daddy
 Push it back on daddy baby
 I seen it vividly jogging my brain memory, life is...
 I seen it vividly jogging my brain memory
 Life no longer infinity this was the final calling
 No birds chirping or flying, no dogs barking
 We all nervous and crying, moving in caution
 In disbeliefs our belief's the reason for all this
 The tallest building plummet, cracking, and crumbling
 The ground is shaking, swallowing young woman
 With a baby, daisies, and other flowers burning in destruction
 The smell is disgusting, the heat is unbearable
 Preachers touching on boys run for cover, the paranoid
 Rapists and murderers hurdle alleys
 Valleys and high places turn into dust
 Famous screaming in agony
 Atheists for suicide, planes falling out the sky
 Trains jumping off the track, mothers yelling ""he's alive""
 Backpedaling Christians settling for forgiveness
 Evidence all around us the town is covered in fishes
 Ocean water dried out, fire burning more tides out
 Tabernacle and city capital turned inside out
 Public bathroom, college classroom's been deserted
 Another trumpet has sounded off and everyone heard it
 (It's happening) no more running from world wars
 (It's happening) no more discriminating the poor
 (It's happening) no more bad bitches and real niggas
 Wishing for green and gold the last taste of allure
 I swore I seen it vividly
 A moniker of war from heaven that play the symphony
 Thunder like number four, then I heard
 ""What have you did for me""
 I fell to my knees, pulled out my resume
 That dated back to June 17th, 1987
 My paperwork was like a receipt
 I was valedictorian, I was fearful of judgment
 But confident I had glory in all my past endeavors
 Close my eyes, pray to God that I live forever
 Dark skies, fire and brimstone, some of us sent home
 Some of us never did wrong but still went to hell
 Geez Louise, I thought you said that I excel
 I made To Pimp a Butterfly for you
 Told me to use my vocals to save mankind for you
 Say I didn't try for you, say I didn't ride for you
 I tithed for you, I pushed the club to the side for you
 Who love you like I love you?
 Crucifix, tell me you can fix
 Anytime I need, I'ma start jotting everything in my diary
 Never would you lie to me
 Always camaraderie, I can see, our days been numbered
 Revelation greatest as we hearing the last trumpet
 All man, child, woman, life completely went in reverse
 I guess I'm running in place trying to make it to church
 Young nigga act an ass
 Young nigga act a fool
 Young nigga get yo' cash
 Young nigga do what it do
 Young nigga go, young nigga go
 Young nigga go, young nigga go
 Whatever makes all of you happy in this bitch
 Just take it all back before the light switch",,,,,,,19 Aug 14,,Ritz Reynolds,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Joe Baldacci,Joe Baldacci;Sounwave,,,,Dominic Angelella,,,,,,,,,,,,,Kendrick Lamar;Bilal;Anna Wise,,http://www.kendricklamar.com/sites/g/files/aaj321/f/styles/suzuki_breakpoints_image_mobile-lg/public/release/201603/319b28a2dff3125ed22e67b6f65056bb971d0259.jpg?itok=wor5XI-H,Vladimir Sepetov,,,https://soundcloud.com/kendricklamarcompton/sets/untitled-unmastered-kendrick,,,,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Untitled_Unmastered,https://www.allmusic.com/album/untitled-unmastered-mw0002926458/credits,https://genius.com/Kendrick-lamar-untitled-01-08192014-lyrics,247,4.12,0.07,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,2,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,X,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1,1,,,,,,,1,,1,,,,,,,,,2,,,,,,1,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

 Lord forgive me, hoping I don't relapse
 Dave just bought a new 911
 Almost thought I’d seen another plane crash

 Rock-a-lack about to buy the projects
 Moosa got his son dripping in gold
 Ali 'bout to let his hair down on hoes

 Might blow the whole no whammy on Soul
 Might tell Obama be more like Punch
 Sounwave caught a Grammy last year
 Mack wop, bet he do what he want
 Fuck you niggas, level two, I'm not done
 2Teez told me that I'm the one
 I can put a rapper on life support
 Guarantee that's something none of you want
 Ten homies down and they all serving life
 What is like twenty-five hundred a month?
 What if I empty my bank out and stunt?
 What if I certified all of these ones?
 Bitch, I get buck, I'm as real as they come
 Shit is amazing, I'm feeding my cravings
 You know that you want me, come here now, lil' baby

 I was tryna spit my best game to her, you know, give her my best cap, but she kept on snapping her fingers like [snaps].
 I said ""You know what, girl? You crazy."" Then she asked me what he said…
 (What did the Asian say?) ""A peace of mind""
 That's what the Asian said—I need a divine
 Intervention was his religion and I was surprised
 Him believing in Buddha, me believing in God
 Asked him what are you doing, he said ""taking my time""
 Meditation is a must, it don't hurt if you try
 See you thinking too much, plus you too full of yourself
 Worried about your career, you ever think of your health?
 (What did the Indian say?) ""A piece of land""
 That's what the Indian said—I needed the man
 Telling me longevity is in the dirt
 Should buy some property first
 Should profit a better dollar with generational perks
 Equity at his best, really, you should invest
 These tangible things expire, don't you expect
 Income with so much outcome and yes
 Look at my heritage, we blessed
 (Now, what the black man say?) ""A piece of pussy""
 That's what the black man said I needed to push me
 To the limit, to satisfy my hunger
 We do it all for a woman from haircut to a war
 We like to live in the jungle, like to play in the peach
 What you saying to me?
 He said ""nigga, come back to reality for a week""
 Pussy is power, fuck on a new bitch every night
 I wouldn't be prouder, you should allow it
 (What the white man say?) A piece of mine's
 That's what the white man wanted when I rhyme
 Telling me that he selling me just for $10.99
 If I go platinum from rapping, I do the company fine
 What if I compromise? He said it don't even matter
 You make a million or more, you living better than average
 You losing your core following, gaining it all
 He put a price on my talent, I hit the bank and withdraw
 Hit the bank and withdraw, hit the bank and withdraw
 Put myself in the rocket ship and I shot for the stars
 ""Look at what you accomplishing""; what he said to the boy
 ""I'ma make you some promises that you just can't ignore
 Your profession anonymous as an artist if I don't target your market
 If you ain't signing your signature when I throw you my wallet
 A lot of rappers are giving their demo all in the toilet
 Your world tour, your master's, mortgage, I need a piece""
 I holler, ""What you do? What you say?""
 I shall enjoy the fruits of my labor if I get freed today
 I holler, ""What you do? What you say?""
 I shall enjoy the fruits of my labor if I get freed today
 What the black man say?

 Somebody said you bumped your head and bled the floor
 Jumped into a pit of flames and burned to coal

 I got 100 on my dash, got 200 in my drum
 Name in the grab bags, put my Bible in the trunk
 Taaka vodka on the top of my binocular, I'm drunk
 How come I can make them popular, pop em' when I want
 See I'm livin' with anxiety, duckin' the sobriety
 Fuckin' up the system, I ain't fuckin' with society
 Justice ain't free, therefore justice ain't me
 So I justify his name on obituary
 Why you wanna see a good man with a broken heart?
 Once upon a time I used to go to church and talk to God
 Now I'm thinkin' to myself, hollow tips is all I got
 Now I'm drinkin' by myself, at the intersection, parked
 Watch you when you walk inside your house
 You threw your briefcase all on the couch
 I plan on creeping through your fuckin' door and blowin' out
 Every piece of your brain until your son jump in your arms
 Cut on the engine, then sped off in the rain, I'm gone

 That's a bit ambitious maybe I'm trippin'
 Maybe I'm crazy, maybe I exist in a different dimension
 Not to mention when I close my eyes I see the distance
 It's such a scary sight so I rarely go to sleep at night
 I watch the sun rise then I watch the sun fall
 Studied the son of God and still don't recognize my flaws
 I guess I'm lost, the cost of being successful is equal to being neglectful
 I pray my experience helps you
 As for me I'm tryna sort it out
 Searching for loopholes in my bruised soul
 But who knows?
 I just need a little space to breathe
 I know perception is key, so I am king
 The other side has never mortified my mortal mind
 The borderline between insanity is Father Time
 I fall behind my skeleton, they tell me that I'm blind
 I know that I'm intelligent, my confidence just died
 Carpe diem, seize the day, I can't compromise
 A tapeworm couldn't cure this gluttonous appetite
 A couple trinkets, they seein' me as I pacify
 But couldn't fathom the meaning of seein' sacrifice
 I'm passin' lives on the daily, maybe I'm losing faith
 Genocism and capitalism just made me hate
 Correctionals and these private prisons gave me a date
 Professional dream killers reason why I'm awake
 I'm sleepwalkin', I'm street stalkin', I'm outta place
 Reinforcing this heat barking, these are the brakes
 Before I blink, do I see me before them pearly gates?

untitled 08 | 09.06.2014.,untitled unmastered.,,8,3:55,Thundercat,Compilation,1,4 Mar 16,8,"Why so sad?
 Walking around with them blue faces
 She said I’m down on my luck
 And it’s something I gotta have
 Blue faces
 I hit the bank today and told them color me bad
 Blue faces
 Get that new money, and it’s breaking me down honey
 Two tears in the bucket I cry with you
 But I could never lie with you
 I could never afford not to afford
 I could never put my plans to the side with you
 I could never see a red light
 Like a deer with a headlight
 I freeze up when I re-up
 See I barely have patience
 And you're relating
 Only the moment to complete us
 Why you hate to work for it?
 The reason I never went to work for it
 See a nine to five was so jive turkey
 But when Thanksgiving came that check didn’t hurt me
 You plead the fifth
 I read the Fifth Amendment
 We both criminals with bad intentions
 They say time heals all
 But if I can shortcut
 My success, Corvettes by tomorrow
 Wait a minute!
 Now, why you so sad?
 Walking around with them blue faces
 She said I’m down on my luck
 And it’s something I gotta have
 Blue faces
 I hit the bank today and told them color me bad
 Blue faces
 Get that new money, and it’s breaking me down honey
 My home girl got a credit card scam
 She got a scholarship to college but she don’t give a damn
 Intuition got a broke bitch wishin'
 She tell me this on the phone with the noodles in the pan
 I know you, woman, I console you, woman
 You feel like the universe owes you, woman
 Oh the anticipation, of hoping you could make it
 Bitches don't prosper chasing education
 But you're talented, and can't handle it
 And your homegirls can't be your manager
 365 times four, plus more
 If you can't get it right, tell me, do you got the stamina?
 But shit, ain't no money like fast money
 Even today I'm considered a crash dummy
 A rapper chasing stardom, how can I fast forward?
 My accolades better than all them
 Why you so sad?
 Walking around with them blue faces
 She said I’m down on my luck
 And it’s something I gotta have
 Blue faces
 I hit the bank today and told them color me bad
 Blue faces
 Get that new money, and it’s breaking me down honey
 I wrote this song looking at a broke home baby (broke home baby)
 You know the poverty stricken the little broke born babies (broke born babies)
 Somebody yell ""Kendrick American, they sho’ is crazy""
 And I said “why?”
 Then he looked me in the eye, and said ""nigga you fucked up""
 You’re banking on good luck, you wishing for miracles
 You never been through shit, you’re crying hysterical
 You settle for everything, complain about everything
 You say you sold crack, my world amphetamine
 Your projects ain’t shit, I live in a hut bitch
 I'm living to keep warm, you living to pay rent
 I prayed my way through by waiting on Allah
 You played your way through, by living in sci-fi
 Bullshitting yourself, you talking to strangers
 Same thing goes for the ones you came with
 When y'all came on the boat looking for hope
 And all you can say is that you’re looking for dope
 These days ain’t no compromise
 And your pain ain’t mines half the time
 A brand new excuse ain’t shit to me
 Bitch, I made my moves, with shackled feet
 Cape Town
 In today's day and age we practice the self pity of taking the easy way out
 You wait on them, him and her
 But when a blessing takes too long, that's when you go wrong
 You selfish motherfucker
 Why so sad?
 Walking around with them blue faces
 She said I’m down on my luck
 And it’s something I gotta have
 Blue faces
 I hit the bank today and told them color me bad
 Blue faces
 Get that new money, and it’s breaking me down honey

 (Know why I go easy)
 Wait
 King of my city, king of my country, king of my homeland
 King of the filthy, king of the fallen, we livin' again
 King of the shooters, looters, boosters, and ghettos poppin'
 King of the past, present, future, my ancestors watchin'
 King of the culture, king of the soldiers, king of the bloodshed
 King of the wisdom, king of the ocean, king of the respect
 King of the optimistics and dreamers that go and get it
 King of the winner's district and geniuses with conviction
 King of the fighters, king of the fathers, king of the belated
 King of the answer, king of the problem, king of the forsaken
 King of the empathy, your resentment, king of remorse
 King of my enemies, may they fall defeat, I rejoice
 King of the skyscrapers, dodgin' haters, broke religion
 Nine faces, go against 'em, I erased 'em with precision
 I embrace them with collision, kings did it
 King's vision, Black Panther, King Kendrick, all hail the king!
 I dropped a million tears
 I know several responsibilities put me here
 I don't pedal backwards, but I live old-fashioned
 The lens that I'm lookin' through
 Won't prescribe me the right glasses, masses are now free
 Ashes I'm dumpin' out, 'bout to spread all 'cross seas
 Sisters and brothers in unison, not because of me
 Because we don't glue with the opposition, we glue with peace
 But still'd fuck up your organization if any beef
 What do you stand for?
 Are you a activist? What are your city plans for?
 Are you a accident? Are you just in the way?
 Your native tongue contradictin' what your body language say
 Are you a king or you jokin'? Are you a king or you posin'?
 Are you a king or you smokin' bowl rocks to keep you open?
 Because the king don't cry, king don't die
 King don't lie, king give all, king get by, king don't fall
 Kingdom come, when I come, you know why
 King! King! King! King! King!

All the Stars,Black Panther,,2,3:56,,Soundtrack,1,9 Feb 18,14,"Love, let's talk about love
 Is it anything and everything you hoped for?
 Or do the feeling haunt you?
 I know the feeling haunt you
 This may be the night that my dreams might let me know
 All the stars approach you, all the stars approach you, all the stars approach you
 This may be the night that my dreams might let me know
 All the stars are closer, all the stars are closer, all the stars are closer
 Tell me what you gon' do to me
 Confrontation ain't nothin' new to me
 You can bring a bullet, bring a sword, bring a morgue
 But you can't bring the truth to me
 Fuck you and all your expectations
 I don't even want your congratulations
 I recognize your false confidence
 And calculated promises all in your conversation
 I hate people that feel entitled
 Look at me crazy 'cause I ain't invite you
 Oh, you important?
 You the moral to the story? You endorsin'?
 Motherfucker, I don't even like you
 Corrupt a man's heart with a gift
 That's how you find out who you dealin' with
 A small percentage who I'm buildin' with
 I want the credit if I'm losin' or I'm winnin'
 On my momma, that's the realest shit
 Love, let's talk about love
 Is it anything and everything you hoped for?
 Or do the feeling haunt you?
 I know the feeling haunt you
 This may be the night that my dreams might let me know
 All the stars approach you, all the stars approach you, all the stars approach you
 This may be the night that my dreams might let me know
 All the stars are closer, all the stars are closer, all the stars are closer
 Skin covered in ego
 Get to talkin' like ya involved, like a rebound
 Got no end game, got no ways out, got to stay down
 It's the way that you making me feel
 Like nobody ever loved me like you do, you do
 You kinda feeling like you're tryna get away from me
 If you do, I won't move
 I ain't just cry for no reason, I ain't just pray for no reason
 I give thanks for the days, for the hours
 And another way, another life breathin'
 I did it all 'cause it feel good
 I wouldn't do it at all if it feel bad
 Better live your life, we're runnin' out of time
 Love, let's talk about love
 Is it anything and everything you hoped for?
 Or do the feeling haunt you?
 I know the feeling haunt you
 This may be the night that my dreams might let me know

 Trapped inside a burnin' church
 Made it out alive, God know my worth
 Raw face, Scarface
 Y'all face more defeat, I know it hurts

 Got 20 in my hand, got 20 on judge
 Gave 20 to my dog, got 20 on girls
 That'll fuck you to— (zoom zoom zoom)
 That'll fuck you then fuck you over
 Take your safe, take your keys, take your Rover
 Take the heart you thought you had

 But at night, we still committin' crimes, spittin' rhymes
 Bought a coupe with the spinnin' rims, get inside
 Bring a friend, bleedin' hands from the genocide
 Clean me up, beam me up to the other side
 Brothers die, 'cause 'coons turn to butterflies
 They don't wanna see me sittin' in the Benz
 They don't wanna see me livin' on the end
 Of the city in a citywide bend
 Show no pity in the city full of sin
 They don't wanna see me gettin' to the check
 They just wanna see me swimmin' in the debt

 I move like a millipede
 When I flex them tendons like rubber trees
 Young Millie Jackson back to the shit
 Mouthpiece drawn, got a verbal armory
 Stack bodies, not figurines
 Move beneath the surface, submarine
 I'm half machine, obscene with a light sword
 Look inside the brain, it's a riot in the psych ward
 What you standing on the side for?
 Roar like a lioness, punch like a cyborg
 Spit slick, attack is subliminal
 Flowers on my mind, but the rhyme style sinister
 Stand behind my own bars, like a seasoned criminal
 Gotham City Streets, I'll play the *bleep*
 Crushing any system, that belittles us
 Antidote to every poison they administer
 Switch it like time signatures
 Colors in my aura tend to cover the perimeter
 Brown bodies that the blues wanna shoot through
 Hi-res lasers wanna (zoom, zoom, zoom)
 Wool over your eyes
 My strength ain't nothing like my size
 Blades on the top, Kathleen Cleaver
 Tangle my cords like a weaver

 And of course, somebody's always gonna say somethin'
 Try and shoot me down for voicin' my own opinion

 Don't be scared to put the fears to shame
 When you know what you got
 Sacrifice ain't that hard
 Feel like dependin' on me
 Sometimes we ain't meant to be free
 When you know what you got
 Sacrifice ain't that hard
 Feel like dependin' on me
 Sometimes we ain't meant to be free
 If who I am offends you, don't feel sorry
 Don't feel, don't feel sorry, don't feel, don't feel sorry
 My loss is worth more than your wins
 I'm satisfied if it starts over again
 That is everything, that is everything
 That is everything, that is everything
 That is everything—
 I try to make it stop, I pray it will stop
 I try to make it stop, I pray it will stop
 I, stop, I am what you not

Paramedic!,Black Panther,,7,3:39,,Soundtrack,1,9 Feb 18,14,"I am Killmonger
 No one's perfect
 But no one's worthless
 We ain't deservin' of everything Heaven and Earth is
 But word is, good, (This is my home)
 Said no one's perfect, but no ones worth this
 We ain't deservin' of everything heaven and Earth is
 But word is, good (Northern California)
 Ayy, they better call a paramedic in the street
 I got leverage in the street
 I'm a California nigga and I'm heavy in the streets
 .22 or .23, I'm heavy with the heat
 Hit you with this chop, paramedics can't save you (Can't save you)
 Really in the field c'mon bro, I know that ain't you (No, it ain't you)
 2018, hell naw, I ain't gon fade you
 Gon' paint you, TDE and SOB, we can't lose
 Niggas bitch made
 That's just somethin' I can't relate to (Can't relate to)
 Turn on the gang
 That's just somethin' that I can't do (No, I can't do)
 Fall out over a bitch
 That's just somethin' that I can't do (No, I can't do)
 Rip every beat I get on, I was made to (I was made to)
 This Glock get to growlin', somethin' like a black panther
 Tryna touch a mil, fuck sayin ""get yo bands up""
 Fuckin' with the gang, yeah, I had to man up
 One fist in the air, I ain't finna put my hands up (Gang!)

 Got shooters tappin' in, nigga for them bands, nigga
 West Coast niggas; yeah, they blowin' fans, nigga
 I know I'm the man, baby, bring your friends with you
 Puttin' points up while you in the stands, nigga
 But I be stuck in these streets, you in the background
 Ever since they took my brother, gotta pack rounds
 Sorry momma, two bails, took a bad route
 I done got my bands up, a nigga stacked now
 But we been still OT on that bullshit (On that bullshit)
 I don't wanna have to do it, empty full clips (Empty full clips)
 Why these niggas talkin' robbin', they don't do shit
 High Cali niggas tapped in, we'll cook shit
 Bust down on my neck, niggas reach, gettin' stretched
 Rockin' with this TEC, niggas better wear a vest
 Last year, I was broke, young nigga in the Crest
 Now a show 20 or better, broke niggas keep the rest
 I wish a nigga would
 I wish a nigga would, I wish a nigga would
 I wish a nigga would
 I wish a nigga would, I wish a nigga would

 California nigga and I'm heavy in these streets
 If you don't keep a pole how you ready when it's beef
 (If you don't keep a pole)
 Lil nigga think he cut, yeah, I bet the nigga freeze
 If that nigga want me dead, I can't let that nigga breathe
 Want me gone, sent a shot, like the real kind
 These niggas actin' like they tough when they real kind
 Thumbin' through a 100 racks just to kill time
 They got a nigga at the edge, but I feel fine
 But it come with this shit, I'm okay with it
 If your man's to his last share a plate wit' 'em
 One whole wood to the neck, it's an eighth in it
 New baby chop, let it sing, it's a Drake nigga
 A lot of shit on my mind make me think a lot
 Why it's hard for me to smile? 'Cause I seen a lot
 You ain't really in the field, you just tweet a lot
 If we ain't on the same page, you can kick a rock, bitch!
 And I been really tryna keep the peace
 But I'm a north Vallejo nigga, and I'm heavy in the streets
 I was raised by my granny and the gangsters
 So at eight I made the choice I'ma forever be a G, and
 I don't really like to talk
 I remember we was broke and I don't really like to walk, nigga
 Now I ride around in foreign cars
 And I put on for my team who was with me from the start, nigga
 I don't play games, stitch lip, I don't say names
 She want a dog, I'm a Great Dane
 I got great aim, Ice Age on my damn chain
 My momma told me keep a stash for the damn rain
 They ain't wanna see me win 'cause I'm black
 So I pulled up in that all black Benz in the back

 Blood on my hands, I'ma need hot agua
 You gon' meet yo' maker, I won't say it in Patois
 Hope I strike a nerve like a package of matches
 You might wanna bypass, this smoke ain't gas trick
 A prince-turned-pauper tryna to do like kings do
 Sweatin' in chess games, tryna move like kings move
 You should slow your roll before you drown in a moat
 He tried to channel balance, but never found the remote
 Killers on the prowl still juggin' off a lick
 Still a— with a double for his *bleep*
 Common politics, everlastin' mayhem
 Draw to stick you for your figures, that's how they hang man
 So what's your game plan if you got one?
 You aimin' at passengers with a shotgun? Whoa
 The aftermath is you in the scope
 It's warfare, is war fair? No
 You understand? It's probably better you don't
 Just keep a dock on standby, charter a boat
 Ships set sail and planes depart
 The big picture's in motion, are you playin' your part?
 Before the lights get dark and the curtains get closed
 Are you playin' your role?
 As told by an organized criminal
 In general, get off my genitals, I got your general

 I had to be about nine when I first had seen it
 Low-lows pulled up outside of the Ralph's
 After a car show at Dominguez
 They had a disagreement, they had to air out (air out)
 Just another day in Del Amo
 Fo' sho, man down, mando
 (Thank) thank God I never had to knock your partner off
 Or be another casualty of war, amen
 There's four footprints in the sand where I walk
 I never claimed to be a saint at all
 Four Russians trippin' with hollow tips
 And a Kalashnikov, aimed at y'all (kla kla kla!)
 No, Soulo, ho, kept it clean
 Ridin' dirty, jury would have gave me thirty
 Herbie love buggin' out, hit the target blindfolded
 Electorial college devoted
 To hit the score, to write the score that's not a metaphor
 Ragin' against the machinery, tapin' up the scenery
 You gotta keep the piece to keep the peace
 Got dough, squad up and mopped the block up for a cleanin' fee
 I don't need you to change
 I don't need you to change

 But I've got to get away (get, get away, get away)

 I carry my city like guilt that ain't got no forgiveness
 No way out, shit we locked in the system
 Catch a case and they not gon' forgive ya

 Shit, auntie missed eight of those days
 Tears from me, had to pray those days
 Had to slave those days
 Shit, we had to hit up a couple hood giveaways those days
 Thank God for every inch that he gave us
 Thank God for everything cause he made us
 Like when that car bent the block, blat blat
 Hit the homie but we made it to ER and he saved us
 Thinkin' that he could've died, nigga
 We was prayin' to the sky and his momma cried rivers
 Healed up, but tough luck, he tried to get revenge

Pray for Me,Black Panther,,14,3:31,,Soundtrack,1,9 Feb 18,14,"Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh
 I'm always ready for a war again
 Go down that road again
 It's all the same
 I'm always ready to take a life again
 You know I'll ride again
 It's all the same (Ooh, ooh, ooh)
 Tell me who's gon' save me from myself
 When this life is all I know
 Tell me who's gon' save me from this hell
 Without you, I'm all alone
 Who gon' pray for me?
 Take my pain for me?
 Save my soul for me?
 'Cause I'm alone, you see
 If I'm gon' die for you
 If I'm gon' kill for you
 Then I spilled this blood for you, hey
 I fight the world, I fight you, I fight myself
 I fight God, just tell me how many burdens left
 I fight pain and hurricanes, today I wept
 I'm tryna fight back tears, flood on my doorsteps
 Life a livin' hell, puddles of blood in the streets
 Shooters on top of the building, government aid ain't relief
 Earthquake, the body dropped, the ground breaks
 The poor run with smoke lungs and Scarface
 Who need a hero? (Hero)
 You need a hero, look in the mirror, there go your hero
 Who on the front lines at ground zero? (Hero)
 My heart don't skip a beat, even when hard times bumps the needle
 Mass destruction and mass corruption
 The souls of sufferin' men
 Clutchin' on deaf ears again, rapture is comin'
 It's all prophecy and if I gotta be sacrificed for the greater good
 Then that's what it gotta be
 Who gon' pray for me?
 Take my pain for me?
 Save my soul for me?
 'Cause I'm alone, you see
 If I'm gon' die for you
 If I'm gon' kill for you
 Then I spilled this blood for you, hey
 Hey, hey, hey, hey
 Hey, hey, hey, hey
 Who gon' pray for me?
 Take my pain for me?
 Save my soul for me?
 'Cause I'm alone, you see
 If I'm gon' die for you
 If I'm gon' kill for you
 Then I spilled this blood for you, hey
 Just in case my faith go, I'll live by my own law
 I'll live by my own law, I'll live by my own
 Just in case my faith go, I'll live by my own law

Is It Love,Kendrick Lamar,,1,4:00,,EP,1,31 Dec 09,15,"Sit still, and close your eyes (Smoke to it)
 What's behind the other door, oh
 No more silence, don't kill this thing we got called love
 Just searching for the perfect shot
 When love comes calling, don't love back
 When love comes calling, don't look away
 When love comes calling, don't look back
 When love comes calling, don't look away
 I used to write rhymes, all day and all night
 While you were playing PlayStation, my pencil was erasing lines
 My conscious only knew whats half tight
 At 3:14, it's time to give me a slice, my nigga
 This is a dog's fight, my nigga
 The soundtrack to life, my nigga
 Kendrick Lamar, his momma called him that
 He watched House Party, and ate Apple Jacks
 Sold Sega games, his cousin sold crack
 He pumped Reeboks, his uncles pumped packs
 Pump, fake, jumpshot, ball hit the back
 Board dreams of being pointguard was off limits jack
 That's because that's these Compton streets was built not to win
 You killed the nigga, I stole a bible, is that a sin?
 Pardon me though, I'm searching for answers
 The good kid from the ugly city, that's mad that he's handsome
 Where is the love?
 When love comes calling, don't love back
 When love comes calling, don't look away
 When love comes calling (Where is the love?), don't look back
 When love comes calling, don't look away
 Give me rings, give me chains, mane
 Give me a blue Benz, red Porsche, red Range
 Give me black bitches, white hoes, new clothes
 A mansion with marble floors and security codes
 Then give me some land, or maybe I'll land a, G5
 Clearport, say hello to the man
 Give me awards, grammies, and let the crowd applaud
 My name 'til they strain the veins in they vocal cords
 Give me fame and fortune, me and Trump on golf courses
 With that being said, give me Tiger sports endorsements
 Give me billboards, whatever that people will kill for
 Manahattan and 40/40, no 40's but rose poured
 Give me vanity, give me Kurt Cobain sanity
 Give me a city where Channel 7 newscasters cameras be
 Give me horror like Amity, no, give me the charts
 And if you ever renege, I'll still give you Kendrick Lamar, this is me
 And that's love
 When love comes calling, don't love back
 When love comes calling, don't look away
 When love comes calling, don't look back
 When love comes calling, don't look away
 Now everybody smoke to it, for this is, the celebration",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"https://hw-img.datpiff.com/m9537590/Kendrick_Lamar_Kendrick_Lamar-front.jpg

Celebration,Kendrick Lamar,,2,3:51,,EP,1,31 Dec 09,15,"For the record, I used to do a lot of humping when I was little
 I got a lot of whoopings over that shit too, and that's random, but so what? Ha-ha-ha
 Gimme that beat fool, this a full time jack
 No really this a Sounwave track
 So really I ain't gotta steal nothing all I gotta do is kill it
 When you press record button let the paralyzed feel it
 I came back with a full time swag
 And the critics thought they had me
 Nah, I just bought more batteries
 Turned up supercharged, a medium away from living large
 Matter fact where my niggas at?
 Where my bitches with them pretty weaves?
 Enemies bleed on the maxi pad, pussy you fucked with the wrong one
 I'm on one, I'll make sure your kids breathe pneumonia
 Good kid, m.A.A.d city evil in my heart
 From the blood niggas fucking with me, crip niggas tryna kill me
 Malcolm X mind state, if I raise the crime rate
 It's a legitimate reason why
 I put on repeat Kanye's ""Touch the Sky""
 But I'll be looking past that I'm tryna touch God
 My heart to the heavens, the rebel of the reverend
 Y'all married to the game well I'm 'bout to crash weddings
 I put a lot of pain in the shit I write
 If you going through something, this the shit you recite
 This is bigger than life, this is Kendrick Lamar
 This is Jimi Hendrix guitar on tour, bonjour, I mean war like that!
 Yeah, straight like that
 People don't be shy
 Release them balloons to the sky
 I need the world to celebrate me! (One time)
 You'll never know when I'm gone (Two times)
 In 2010, I'm tryna ball, nigga!
 Like shooting jumpshots in the mall, nigga!
 That's a quote from Ab-Soul
 I suppose since you laugh that's the ultimate goal
 On behalf of the Top Dawg conglomerate, shall stay anonymous
 Searching seven continents accomplishing big shit
 Big ass, big tits she on me
 And just to get to me she'll fuck the homies... homie's homies
 The life of a cool nigga, my nigga Tony said
 ""Just do you, nigga!"" Show and prove, nigga
 And they gon' play you for a fool that's for sure
 'til they know you got the stinkiest stool, nigga!""
 I ain't tripping I'm just tipping on fo-fo's
 Back in the city and tipping on four hoes
 That boy got a cold cold, he's sick con, slick on
 Dropin red jewels like a school bar mitzvah, ooh
 Straight like that
 People don't be shy
 Release them balloons to the sky
 I need the world to celebrate me! (One time)
 You'll never know when I'm gone (Two times)
 Why y'all complain about OG's?
 I don't look at a legend and say you owe me
 Not Snoop, not Dre, not Ice Cube
 I don't care me and Quik went to the same school
 I look in the mirror and do it myself
 Like a self made nigga, I don't need a maid, nigga
 Do I need a co-sign from Dre or Jigga?
 They can make me much bigger
 But do I need 'em though?, I just need a flow
 The type of shit that make you think you seen Pac ghost
 ""Me Against The World"" on you mothafuckas
 I got my back against the wall and a .45, dog get smoked, Chris Tucker
 Uhh, tryna record my steelo
 Even when I'm not there just like TiVo
 The hoes tell me that I got a real big ego
 And weed move slow right now but E go
 You know what I'm talking 'bout? I look at your Audemars
 To put y'all in time out, it's time to unveil the real
 And your career is about as frail as Ms. Winehouse
 Just salute, grab a flute, and pull the wine out, ooh
 Just like that
 People don't be shy
 Release them balloons to the sky
 I need the world to celebrate me! (One time)
 You'll never know when I'm gone (Two times)",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"https://hw-img.datpiff.com/m9537590/Kendrick_Lamar_Kendrick_Lamar-front.jpg

P&P,Kendrick Lamar,,3,4:42,,EP,1,31 Dec 09,15,"Oh what up, ho? Oh, what up?
 I said oh, what up, ho? Oh, what up?
 I said oh, what up, ho? Oh, what up?
 Well, alright
 I'm going through something with life
 But pussy and Patrón make you feel alright
 Pussy and Patrón make you feel alright
 Pussy and Patrón, that's some great advice
 I'm going through something with life
 But pussy and Patrón make you feel alright
 Pussy and Patrón make you feel alright
 Pussy and Patrón, that's some great advice
 Welcome to my diary, stressing got me gray hairs
 Something to inspire me, rather than society's
 Woes, let me go, let me shine a lil' bit love
 I want diamonds too, Ronnie on Player's Club
 I used to have a 9 to 5, fresh out of school that was '05
 That bitch was racist, got me fired, ever since then I had no job
 Pushing in my mama van, stop for gas on Rosecrans
 Trust me these niggas rushed me for something my cousin probably did
 Guilty by association story of my life, nigga
 You gone make me flip then split your shit, judge give me life, nigga
 Pain since my grandma's death, uncle killed at Louis's Burgers
 Hold my tears I tried my best, let it go drench my pullover
 Cycles of a starving artist tryna go beyond the margin's margin
 Maintaining my modest, modest as I dream
 So while I go through all this, all this bullshit what you call it
 Life itself I know it helps let me scroll through my Blackberry
 Hey, whats up, daddy?
 I'm going through something with life
 But pussy and Patrón make you feel alright
 Pussy and Patrón make you feel alright
 Pussy and Patrón, that's some great advice
 I'm going through something with life
 But pussy and Patrón make you feel alright
 Pussy and Patrón make you feel alright
 Pussy and Patrón, that's some great advice
 I said keep reading my diary, when my life's entirely
 Surrounded by the irony of living in the city
 I said they wouldn't hire me, I said I got my ass beat
 And the only thing can help is ass and some titties
 So what's up, baby? I said what's up?
 I had a long day and I really wanna fuck
 See I ain't tryna think about no phone bills
 Credit card late fees, Capital One popping up on my caller ID
 Pawning my chain in the shop, watching for hollow-tip shots
 Watching my vehicle break down on another man's block
 Man that's my worst fear, ain't that your worst fear
 You know when your transmission go out and can't switch gears
 Or run through a pothole at two in the morning
 Scared to hit your emergencies cause then they'll be on it
 See I know when the harsh reality take its toll
 Open up your contacts then scroll
 Hey, whats up daddy
 I'm going through something with life
 But pussy and Patrón make you feel alright
 Pussy and Patrón make you feel alright
 Pussy and Patrón, that's some great advice
 I'm going through something with life
 But pussy and Patrón make you feel alright
 Pussy and Patrón make you feel alright
 Pussy and Patrón, that's some great advice
 Welcome to my diary, hmm.. where should I begin?
 Finna get a Swisher and fill it with at least a gram
 Crackers watch my every step, better yet they work my every nerve
 Cutting me this worthless check, the concept is so absurd
 Like a church in debt, a turtle in a turtle neck
 Convertibles with turbojets, fueled by 7-Up and prometh'
 I feel like deaths around the corner like the quickest wide receiver
 So I took another shot, Tequila hit me like a nina
 My sky's gray, my bitches brighter
 Always saying lights please, J. Cole's her ghost writer
 And I'm the God MC, join my diocese
 Free your mind, don't mind society
 And finally, everyone got their own problems
 Everything is subject to change like broken dollars
 I'ma drown in my drink and swim in my woman's vagina
 Like a piranha fin, it gets harder than Rihanna when
 I'm going through something with life
 But pussy and Patrón make you feel alright
 Pussy and Patrón make you feel alright
 Pussy and Patrón, that's some great advice
 I'm going through something with life
 But pussy and Patrón make you feel alright
 Pussy and Patrón make you feel alright
 Pussy and Patrón, that's some great advice",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"https://hw-img.datpiff.com/m9537590/Kendrick_Lamar_Kendrick_Lamar-front.jpg

She Needs Me,Kendrick Lamar,,4,3:31,,EP,1,31 Dec 09,15,"One time, reporting live, Compton, California
 She go to work, she go to school, her body smooth, no tattoos
 Type of girl that’ll make your mother feel comfortable
 My pops love her too, she’s compatible, she’s independent
 She handle her business, she believe in God and no other religions
 She's never in competition, when it comes to her friends, she's dependable
 She set her own trends, a confidant, a mediator, so sweet, every flavor
 Just a conversation with her doing you a favor, look at her hips, I want to be her pager
 Conservative, affirmative, actually she relaxing in sweats and bobby pins
 The beauty of her, a blind man can see, a true queen and she needs me
 She needs me, she needs me, she needs me, she needs me
 The beauty of her, swear to God, a blind man can see, a true queen and she needs me
 That girl is smoking, and can you believe that I'm her focus?
 It ain’t hard to see she got me open, and together we are roller-coasting on
 Five years later, an accounting major, work at a firm
 Abundance of paper, she got a career, she look in the rear
 View mirror of a Mercedes that she can steer
 Call her boss, executive meetings, consecutive trips, vacational weekends
 Dior reeking through her Prada dress, probably the only product of her pure success
 Got a promotion, now she own the building
 Headed to the top like she on the building, real estate, property
 She order tender steak, only one mouth to feed, funded a youth center
 Invested in some stock, doubled what she put in, then bought a restaurant
 Oh what a girl, how great life can be, even though she got the world, she needs me
 She needs me, she needs me, she needs me, she needs me
 Oh what a girl, wonder how her life can be, and though she got the world, she needs me
 That girl is smoking, and can you believe that I'm her focus?
 It ain’t hard to see she got me open, and together we are roller-coasting on
 We lose touch, separated, years pass, I’m outdated
 She’s dating one of Hollywood’s famous entertainers, Denzel good
 Paparazzi spot ‘em out shopping, Tuesday morning brunch, Benihana's
 Tabloids paint a picture of a perfect couple
 Headline reads when a famous actor loves you, Emmy Awards, Academy too
 On the red carpet, dress matching his suit, she holding his arm
 She waves at her moms and wave at the world, got the world in her palms
 Head in the clouds, star gazing, caught her on the stage, a proposal was waiting
 He bent down, got on one knee, she looked him in the eye and said she needs me
 She needs me, she needs me, she needs me, she needs me
 Even if we seem to separate, eventually it’ll come to pass, and she’ll need me
 I need her, we need we
 That girl is smoking, and can you believe that I'm her focus?
 It ain’t hard to see she got me open, and together we are roller-coasting on",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"https://hw-img.datpiff.com/m9537590/Kendrick_Lamar_Kendrick_Lamar-front.jpg

I Am,Kendrick Lamar,,5,1:20,,EP,1,31 Dec 09,15,"See y'all don't understand me
 My plan B is to win ya hearts before I win a Grammy
 Kendrick Lamar, words like a sword in the hands of a Spartan
 Marching on Rosecrans in Compton
 You can't cause conflict or corrupt my spirit
 I'm on point like period
 I've been there and gone before you get near it
 Ooh wee, that boy remind me of a young Martin Luther
 The way he piece up troopers, then round up shooters
 Like Malcolm X did, I stand for what I believe in
 Family, God and honor
 From Chicago, my daddy and my momma
 Came to Compton to accomplish one thing
 Raise a king, reign supreme, named Kendrick
 I ain't lying, it stand for king and I am one
 My unborn son and grandson will live royal
 From the coochie to the soil
 The meek shall inherit the Earth
 Well I've had this world since birth
 Feel the good kid's hunger
 The Crips made strong, the Pirus made stronger
 Muscle in my heart
 Stare at the eyes of Mozart, then tell him I'm the genius
 Do my dougie and grab my penis
 Cause I means this with all my soul
 And you can't control greatness 'less you hating with the heart of Satan
 But even that can't stop it
 Nigga, get out my wallet and put passion in your logic
 Passion in your life, the passion of my Christ is in me
 And if you say it ain't, you may offend me
 Damn that boy good
 Bright as Thomas Edison, but Gucci man hood
 He stood alone for so long
 Prolonged his whole career, but now he's here
 You can shoot shots or cheer cause I am",,Yes,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"https://hw-img.datpiff.com/m9537590/Kendrick_Lamar_Kendrick_Lamar-front.jpg

Wanna Be Heard,Kendrick Lamar,,6,4:37,,EP,1,31 Dec 09,15,"It's like I don't think you fully understand who I am, ya know?
 I'm just a good kid from Compton that wanna rap
 I don't represent no colors, I represent my lil' sisters and brothers
 I'm the oldest, nigga
 And if you can't respect that, your whole perspective is wack
 Check it out
 I used to wanna rap like JAY-Z
 Until I finally realized that Jay wasn't me
 I took my time to jot down every line that's a quotable
 Critics say I don't be killing this shit but I know I do
 Because I used to practice early morning and then after school
 I'm working on my hooks my nigga, I ain't tryna battle you
 But even if I did, I guarantee I'd overshadow you
 Like a fucked up taper that turned to bowl cut
 I'mma close cut to Common and Gucci Mane
 Now that's a comparison that you probably wouldn't understand
 Because I can touch the people and still keep it ghetto
 As an '87 Regal with the tree air freshener on the rearview mirror
 I wear a heart on my shoulder
 'Member when we used to make the boost look like Motorola?
 Your cousin fucked up your room every time he came over
 Then went to jail when we got older
 That shit is a bad odor, but still I remain focused
 In due time, I'll be able to swipe my card and it won't say decline
 That shit's embarrassing huh
 Hope no one pay you no mind
 But it's a bad bitch behind you while you standing in line
 Can you relate to my story? Can you follow my dreams
 And admirations that I had ever since I was thirteen?
 My momma believed in me, she let me use her van to go to the studio
 Even though she know her tank is empty, that's who I do it fo'
 My pops got a different approach, yeah he believed
 But he always questioned when I'mma drop my debut CD
 How long this gon' take nigga? You still haven't ate nigga
 At twenty-two I had two cars and my own place nigga
 It's a sacrifice I try to tell him
 That's when he turn to BET and tell me that he jealous
 Of all these niggas getting money and their shit don't sound like shit
 I ain't tryna kill your confidence or forcing you to quit
 I just wanna hear you heard
 Yep, yep, that's my word
 Make a statement with these nouns and verbs
 I represent the liquor that's poured out on the curb
 Listen to my nouns and verbs (Man, I wanna be heard)
 Like a cattle with sheep
 While y'all sleep I be up, cooking up all day
 Like a mad scientist in that laboratory
 Motherfuck what a critic got to say, I'ma be heard
 What up DZYNE? I ain't forgot nigga
 You developed me, telling me I was hot nigga
 You believed in me first, that's what's for sure
 At the church recording, at the garage, but it worked
 But me and Dave kind of felt you lost the passion
 A lot was going on in your life and you needed space
 But still I should have came to you first to tell you what happened
 But I was seventeen and figured it's best I stay away
 And I was wrong, I was young and couldn't look you in the eye for what I'd done
 But I'm telling you we ain't done
 Matter of fact, how's your sons? What they up to?
 Remember they used to run away while you had worked on ProTools?
 People I used to be in the booth till four in the morning
 With school in the morning, yawning, but I was on it
 Me, you and Dave was on it
 Buzzing like Charlotte Hornets when that tape dropped
 Where them beats nigga? It's been five years since we had rocked
 Time to be heard
 Yep, yep, that's my word
 Make a statement with these nouns and verbs
 I represent the liquor that's poured out on the curb
 Listen to my nouns and verbs (Man, I wanna be heard)
 Like a cattle with sheep
 While y'all sleep I be up, cooking up all day
 Like a mad scientist in that laboratory
 Motherfuck what a critic got to say, I'ma be heard
 So can you feel it?
 When you hear it do it pulsate your spirit?
 Do it make you wanna say motherfuck a gimmick?
 The truth can set you free if you Do the Right Thing
 Word to Spike Lee, don't he look like Sounwave?
 That's kinda random, but my humor sometimes strays
 Like a dog in the night
 Twenty-four hours in a day but only take five minutes
 To grab a pad and a pen, then send your dog a kite
 I spread love like a Hippy, but I'm a Black one
 With Jesus Christ passion, I swear on the bible
 Tabernacle to all my rivals, I ain't mad
 You hate a nigga for tryna help you, that's your bad
 Because I figure I can make a way with these stanzas
 I probably can't heal cancer, but I can heal the city
 My niggas, tell me you with me
 And if you is won't you pop my CD in
 Open up your trunk, then let it bump, so I can be heard
 Yeah, uh huh
 Yep, yep, that's my word
 Make a statement with these nouns and verbs
 I represent the liquor that's poured out on the curb
 Listen to my nouns and verbs (Man, I wanna be heard)
 Like a cattle with sheep
 While y'all sleep I be up, cooking up all day
 Like a mad scientist in that laboratory
 Motherfuck what a critic got to say, I'ma be heard
 D-Dave, what up nigga?

I Do This,Kendrick Lamar,,7,4:08,,EP,1,31 Dec 09,15,"The homies say I'm the truest
 The bitches think I'm the cutest
 The definition what cool is
 Boy, I thought you knew this
 Bitch, I do this!
 Uh, I used to wanna be like Michael Jordan
 Figured that I hit the NBA and make a fortune
 Thank God for these rap recordings
 I can ball like him on every verse and chorus
 501s, Louis letterman jacket
 Little brother only 5, momma put him on my taxes
 You know that Compton ghetto shit
 That every section 8 tenant is familiar with
 Ooh wee, they say he something like the 70s
 But I'm from '87, with a thousand dimes
 You got 80 sevens
 Gourmet sneakers, hair nappy
 Fucking all my high school teachers
 That was '05 bro
 And I don't like 'em if the ass thin
 And I don't wife 'em if a nigga is her best friend
 The fuck I look like?
 A million bucks, and that's why
 The homies say I'm the truest
 The bitches think I'm the cutest
 The definition what cool is
 Boy, I thought you knew this
 Bitch, I do this!
 Bitch, I do this!
 Bitch, I do this!
 The definition what cool is
 Boy, I thought you knew this
 Bitch, I do this
 She looking at the car like she wanna fuck it
 She looking at the wrist like she wanna fuck it
 Hating on her girlfriend just so I can fuck it
 She say she on birth control, no I don't trust it (Ho)
 Uh, So give me fifty feet champ
 Run until I got a bunion and my feet cramp
 I'm in the hot spot, I know they seats damp
 And I don't need your cosign, that's a cheap stamp
 You-you niggas check this cash and I'm GT crashing
 105 off-ramp, hey
 And little nigga got it going on, G5
 Going, going, going, gone
 Cloud 9 mind state
 I drop a record then I raise the crime rate
 Killing this shit, where's your funeral tie
 A-B-C-D-E-F-G, fuck skip to Y
 The homies say I'm the truest
 The bitches think I'm the cutest

 Bitch, I do this
 She looking at the car like she wanna fuck it
 She looking at the wrist like she wanna fuck it
 Hating on her girlfriend just so I can fuck it
 She say she on birth control, no I don't trust it
 First off I'm a rider, bitch
 Put them 26's on a Silverado, bitch
 I keep my bitch with a finer bitch
 Snap my fingers, she'll go find a bitch
 Tell them fuck boys that I do this
 Got the best product 'round town, Frank Lucas
 Confuse 'em like a Rubix cube when I roll up
 Ok, Subway bread like some cold cuts
 And I drop cold cuts, bitches go crazy
 Wild like a Haitian, I should set up shop in Haiti
 Fuck you, pay me. Paper over pussy, nigga
 When I drop you ain't getting paper nor pussy, nigga
 Bitch, I do this

Uncle Bobby & Jason Keaton,Kendrick Lamar,,8,4:00,,EP,1,31 Dec 09,15,"I was sitting on the couch reading yellow paper
 A letter in reply, 7 days later after I wrote 'em
 ""Stay strong, keep your faith in God,"" what I told him
 Hoping that he's listening
 Said that they tried to give him like a hundred years
 What a coincidence, I was bumping some Plies
 I can taste the salt from my tears
 As the water had start to flood on my eyes
 I know it gotta be hard being twenty-one
 Doing time in the pen and your Gram's old
 Your brother's getting older
 And the streets is getting colder
 And your hoping that he's focused to stay on the right road
 Sleeping in a cell, it's been 30 weeks
 Ain't recieved any mail
 It's cold and the hole stinks
 And you can't even blink without niggas testing your life
 As I read every word that you write, I can only imagine
 Jason Keaton, I can only imagine
 Life's about decisions man
 It's in your hand and you got it
 Just take control if you can
 It's in your hand and you got it
 Sitting on the couch, that was my Uncle Bobby
 After he just got out, 15 years to count
 Haven't seen the world in so long
 Haven't seen a girl in so long
 And before the sun came up, he was gone
 Like a fiend off the best rock
 Trying to get his life together, or what not
 Typed his name in the system and they couldn't find his identity
 Got it straight, got a place, found some serenity
 Found a job, found his Mother's grave site, found a 40 ounce
 Then he found God, then he bounced, then he found a new chick
 Two kids, wide hips, found something in her we didn't see
 Found this spot in Pasadena and shack with her, an investment
 Then found guilty, somebody had yelled domestic
 Violence on my Uncle, was working with two strikes
 Only out a year, now facing life
 I can only imagine
 That's fucked up
 I can only imagine, Uncle Bob
 Life's about decisions man
 It's in your hand and you got it
 Just take control if you can
 It's in your hand and you got it
 Sitting on the couch, thinking about the ratio
 Of blacks in prison as compact in prison
 When blacks pack with minorities
 System grab more of these eighteen-year-olds
 18 year sentence with no parole
 The state won't oversee
 They make the term severe, a conspiracy?
 That's what I call it, it's full of shit
 A toilet can help quick, the government help?
 No, just put us on death row
 Just give us some more guns, then give us some more coke
 Then give us another chair, then give us some more rope
 Then hang it like right there, yeah
 It's justice for all but 90 percent unfair
 Care? No
 Alcatraz was purchased by a white man
 For 5 grand, with intentions to expand
 More prisons
 So these correctionals ain't for rehabilitation
 They for grossing a bigger business
 Imagine
 We're being used
 Imagine
 The truth shall be told
 Life's about decisions man
 It's in your hand and you got it
 Just take control if you can
 It's in your hand and you got it",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"https://hw-img.datpiff.com/m9537590/Kendrick_Lamar_Kendrick_Lamar-front.jpg

Faith,Kendrick Lamar,,9,4:51,,EP,1,31 Dec 09,15,"I take a sip of Hennessy and then get pissy drunk
 I ain't a drinker, I'm a thinker, call it what you want
 But if you turn your back, know that you just missed your chance
 To witness the realest shit that's ever been told to man
 I found myself losing focus at a Sunday service
 Embarrassed so I start questioning God, ""What is my purpose?""
 He said to live the way he did, that's all he want from me
 Spread the word and witness, he rose on the first Sunday
 I said alright, enthused that my Lord gave a listen
 I opened my Bible in search to be a better Christian
 And this from a person that never believed in religion
 But shit, my life is so fucked up, man; I can't help but give in
 I'm giving testimonies to strangers I never met
 Hopped on the pulpit and told them how I was truly blessed
 Felt like I'm free from all my sins when the service was over
 Walked out the church, then got a call that my homie was murdered
 Then lost my faith again
 What am I gonna do
 Gotta have faith
 Life is too much
 I'm just through
 Where is your faith?
 (Don't you give up dont you give in...)
 Faith
 All you need is the size of a mustard seed
 Single black parent from Compton raising children of four
 That's four innocent bastards 'cause, papa, they don't know
 Her day consists of working back and forth with babysitters
 Can't find no one to watch her kids, so she pay her sister
 Her baby daddy ain't 'bout shit, that nigga ain't 'bout shit
 Spilt his daughter milk just to cop a new outfit
 She pray to God every night, hoping that he'll mature
 And maybe one day his kids something that he'll live for
 Baby wanna go back to school, but she need some help
 Because it's hard trying to pay the bills when you're by yourself
 She thought about credit card scams, 'til she heard a voice
 That said, ""The Devil is a lie, make a better choice""
 And so it's back to McDonald's and every month dealing
 With those crazy ass people at the county building
 Looked to the heavens and asked Him to make a better way
 Then got a letter in the mail, lost her Section 8
 Then lost her faith again
 What am I gonna do
 Gotta have faith
 Life is too much
 I'm just through
 Where is your faith?
 (Don't you give up dont you give in...)
 Faith
 All you need is the size of a mustard seed
 I had dreams of holding a 9 milla to Ray's killa
 Ask him why as my eyes fill up
 Each day it gets more realer, orangutans bang like gorillas
 It's jungle when the niggas in zoo
 The rats lurking, vultures circling the serpents
 Cats lying through they teeth, my nigga didn't deserve it
 I flirted with the ideal of caressing the steel
 To make karma come faster than she normally will
 It's ill, to see my faith try and leave me
 It's so hard to get it, to get rid of it is easy
 I'm tryna reach Cloud 9, that's what my niggas 'bout
 But it never rain in California unless the pistols out
 Until then, my feet planted on the ground
 Shadowboxing my conscience till my faith start responding
 And if I get no answer, just know I tried
 I should have never looked into his son's eyes
 Rayshawn Boyce
 What am I gonna do
 Gotta have faith
 Life is too much
 I'm just through
 Where is your faith?
 (Don't you give up dont you give in...)
 Faith
 All you need is the size of a mustard seed
 This for my people that stressing whenever times is hard
 Your mind's slipping, wondering, ""Is there really a God?""
 Knowing you shouldn't think that way and trying to freeze your brain
 But whenever there's pain, that feeling forever remains
 We can't believe what we can't see and reality seems stronger than prayer
 Cause you tried to change your life, and now you live in a wheelchair
 And your son was born with cancer and he live in urgent care
 At the tender age of 12, and you feel that no one cares
 Searching for answers, that's human nature, you ain't in the wrong
 Just know when you feeling that way His Spirit's in the room
 I watched people I know pray and catch the Holy Ghost
 And wonder why I ain't ever caught that feeling before
 Maybe they know Him better, or I don't know no better
 But what I do know, is that He's real and He lives forever
 So the next time you feel like your world's about to end
 I hope you studied because He's testing your faith again
 I'd rather not live like there isn't a God
 Than die and find out there really is
 Think about it",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"https://hw-img.datpiff.com/m9537590/Kendrick_Lamar_Kendrick_Lamar-front.jpg

Trip,Kendrick Lamar,,10,3:50,,EP,1,31 Dec 09,15,"Boarding completed I'd like to welcome you aboard flight number F2B3
 Our scheduled flying time will be four hours and twenty minutes
 And we will be cruising at an altitude of thirty-three-thousand feet
 At this time we would like to acquaint you with some of the features
 Relax and breathe normally
 Uh, coming down like I'm uphill
 Hogging both lanes better than a bus will
 She tell me that my head bigger than a bus wheel
 But it don't matter cause she still gon' let me fuck still
 I mix a little bit of Kendrick with some L.A. weather
 Then step out like Chicago in its finest era
 You niggas begging for attention, doing extra-extra
 Downgrading yourself, you get an F for effort
 Ha-ha, I let the world know
 I chose to keep to myself and let the world go
 And if you don't like a nigga, then let your girl know
 So she can be curious on Twitter looking me up
 I'm laid back with a bad one, you ain't never had one
 Ass so fat that it tipped over the Aston
 Speeding on the 105 till the fucking badge come
 Hello to my wittiness, I'm Cadillac's grandson
 And I'm a trip
 Ever since an understudy man I've always been a trip
 Mama tell me that she love me but she know her son a trip
 Baby open up your ears, you ain't heard it like this
 Sounwave drop the beat, I lock the flow down
 Now all the way to the moon we bout to go now
 I got enough of the mojo to go around
 So pack your bags and tell him you going out of town
 Cause I'm a trip
 Landing on another runway, fly with me
 Or die tryna fly, a shot-down Frisbee
 Shout out to Black Hippy, nigga we on
 Like we never been off, straight shots of Patron
 I'm give y'all the business to give y'all some business
 Pussy ain't shit, I can give y'all some bitches
 Clean off her sports bra, she clean off my dishes
 Then wear off the Kangols, hood rats, I hate those
 And she know what this is, hey lil' mama
 Seen your pretty ass around the way lil' mama
 But why you always in somebody face lil' mama?
 Embarrassing yourself, get off the stage (Lil Mama)
 Nigga, I gotta be that nigga
 If I ain't, I gotta beat that nigga
 Courtesy of Paula's oldest son, pay homage
 Or pay attention, open your eyes and hear knowledge
 And I'm a trip
 Ever since an understudy man I've always been a trip
 Mama tell me that she love me but she know her son a trip
 Baby open up your ears, you ain't heard it like this
 Sounwave drop the beat, I lock the flow down
 Now all the way to the moon we bout to go now
 I got enough of the mojo to go around
 So pack your bags and tell him you going out of town
 Cause I'm a trip
 Gi-give me that, gi-gi-give me that
 That's how I get at 'em when I look at a shoe rack
 Penny for thoughts, mine start at a few racks
 So I can live on a hill just off a few raps
 I want to live in a space that none of y'all can visit
 That might be outer space, the Jupiter district
 I quadruple my vision
 If you don't see it then you're dead with your eyes open
 I've seen bullets hit the wheel, left his ride smoking
 On some Compton shit
 Somebody that'll ride or die, that's a Compton bitch
 You see my city is the city of Lamar
 It'll take twenty years 'fore a nigga see them all
 The swap meet dumping, the sawed-off pumping
 The tree for the low, don't you know, Paul Bunyan
 I'm on cloud nine, I can see rain coming
 So if I'm out my mind, people don't say nothing
 And I'm a trip
 Ever since an understudy man I've always been a trip
 Mama tell me that she love me but she know her son a trip
 Baby open up your ears, you ain't heard it like this
 Sounwave drop the beat, I lock the flow down
 Now all the way to the moon we bout to go now
 I got enough of the mojo to go around
 So pack your bags and tell him you going out of town
 Cause I'm a trip

Vanity Slaves,Kendrick Lamar,,11,4:15,,EP,1,31 Dec 09,15,"Sometimes I want to leave, sometimes I want to cry
 Sometimes I hate to bear the truth, sometimes I want to lie
 Sometimes I want to school the youth, sometimes I want to ride
 Sometimes I want to not think, sometimes I want to vibe
 Sometimes I want to bump Tribe and zone out
 This song's 'bout a young boy that's gone wild inside
 When my world collide
 With your world where your girl and your kids reside
 We killed the facades, we feel free to fly
 We're birds that reserve in the charismatic sky
 I care about my pride too much
 If my clothes is new, if my ride is plush
 If my hair is cut, if my diamonds is crushed
 I look in the mirror, I'm trendy enough? Wrong
 Insecurity roams the black community
 Homes where kids must have jewelry
 The high school female need earrings and details
 So she can be cool to be, amongst popularity
 The various name brands that reached the price scan
 It's not about the right price but more like the right scam
 To rule us all, confuse us all
 Hit the bank within five minutes and then withdraw
 Now let's draw
 The picture of a rapper with a chain and Range that is not paid for
 My cousin from the South said he just bought him a house
 That lives around his neck like a white collar
 So why fast forward? then I'll rewind, a time machine can help me double back to slavery times
 Picking cotton from a field that a white man own
 The blacker you are, farther you're from the white man's home
 Negro spiritual songs, gave us some type of sanity
 Before your vanity, they parted our families
 They put us in hundred degree shade and outside we bathed
 The more we were afraid, the more they made rules
 And trapped our minds in a cage, our freedom was so vague
 Couldn't see it with the eyes of Tracee Ross (uh)
 And school was exempt, see we couldn't have smarts
 And a smirk could get you hurt, wounded first from a scar
 400 years of nothing, 400 years of suffering
 400 years of tears, and tribulations, miseducation
 See what we facing is now coming back to the roots
 Remember whips on our back and if we would run they would shoot
 Called us niggers and figured that we never live in pursuit
 Of happiness, we capture these feelings in things that we do
 Thought of abstinence of slavery but we made it come to
 About a perspective, my shoe selection gotta be Louie
 Her hand bag gotta be Gucci, it's fake then she fool me
 She still bad though, and her fake Gucci ain't that bad though
 We filling up the gas for Rollies
 Upgrade to 26's after riding Kobes
 My cousin from the South, slavery start in the South and I bet ya
 He overcompensates for the life of his ancestors
 So blame it on the 400 years we never saw
 The reason why the next 400 we gotta floss
 Slaves
 I said the 400 years we never had nothing
 Barely had clothes on our back
 Is the reason why when we get a little bit of change
 We over exaggerate on our living expenses
 So if you get your first big check and you cop a chain before you buy a house
 You're a vanity slave
 If you're a female and you got 4,5,6 rings on your finger
 Four holes in your left ear and a nose piercing
 You're a vanity slave
 If you got an '02 Monte Carlo with 24's on it
 And on the back of the window it says, ""Get on my level ho""
 You're a vanity slave
 We're all vanity slaves, and with that being said
 Can somebody please tell me where the mall at?
 I'm not from around here, hey Ali, where we at? Idaho?
 Yeah nigga, you know the first of the month, checks coming in
 I'm tryna get some

Far From Here,Kendrick Lamar,,12,3:53,,EP,1,31 Dec 09,15,"A nigga so goddamn stressed out
 I feel like fuck everything right now
 See I've been broke too long, can't find a job to save my life
 But I'll be damned if I give 'em my handout
 See my pride is one thing I will not put aside
 I'm too proud to beg, I'm sorry Left-Eye
 If I don't make it in life, motherfucker I tried
 What? Uh
 You ever feel like nobody never understands you but you?
 Not your momma, your poppa, only person is you
 Not your brother, your sister, the only person is you
 You ever feel like nobody never understands you but you?
 Nobody, nobody but you
 So it feels like, like it's only you
 So I'm feeling like I want to, I want to
 I want to, I want to go so far from here
 Very, very far from here
 I need to, I need to
 I need to, I need to go so far from here
 Very, very far from here
 It seems like, you can't win for losing
 Whatever you're doing turns out to be ""what-are-you-doing?""
 Sick of pursuing, that your time will soon come
 Nobody knows the position that you in
 But it's a million people out there that's going through the same thing
 That feeling, hard to explain
 When you just, just want to get away
 Something like
 You ever feel like nobody never understands you but you?
 Not your momma, your poppa, only person is you
 Not your brother, your sister, the only person is you
 You ever feel like nobody never understands you but you?
 Nobody, nobody but you
 So it feels like, like it's only you
 So I'm feeling like I want to, I want to
 I want to, I want to go so far from here
 Very, very far from here
 I need to, I need to
 I need to, I need to go so far from here
 Very, very far from here
 Away from it all
 Take me out of Hell where only Heaven can visit
 The smartest astronomers, they won't even see my vision
 I'm stuck on the studio couch now, thinking bout my daughter
 Times is getting harder, another beat is slaughtered
 Just press record or, seems like I need a mill' to keep my shit in order
 Instead of problem solving
 From my hat to my shoes, spirit laced with pride
 Set some shit aside to help me wipe my teary eyes
 Reaching for the skies, pissing on a cloud
 Shitting on a bird's head, higher than a dread
 As I fly through the galaxy, pain and the agony
 Nothingness surrounding me, living my life
 Though it's better to write
 Configuring my style to the streets, bring dark to the light
 So how you feel? My nigga, I keep it real
 A ScHoolboy soon to be star, Mr. Lamar
 So I'm feeling like I want to, I want to
 I want to, I want to go so far from here
 Very, very far from here
 I need to, I need to
 I need to, I need to go so far from here
 Very, very far from here",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"https://hw-img.datpiff.com/m9537590/Kendrick_Lamar_Kendrick_Lamar-front.jpg

Thanksgiving,Kendrick Lamar,,13,3:39,,EP,1,31 Dec 09,15,"Reporting live, from Compton, California
 North Cackalack
 Now everybody just bow to the greatness, or die in the matrix
 You're hereby dating, my destiny's waiting
 My itinerary is very hectic
 I break records on every record, I'm truly reckless
 Kendrick Lamar, no Audemar on my wrist
 Its arthritis from holding it down bitch
 Me and my down bitch, get busy
 I'm busy taking over, the world
 With the weight of the world on my shoulder
 My drive is not to be chauffeured
 I'm live, come to the harvest, welcome the artist
 Whose lyrics out of the orbit, more than the hardest rapper
 To hit the market and market myself as a shooting target
 With offers that got me up in these offices often
 Boo-yaa, who ya? No one, I've done situated myself, I ain't lying
 Be sure to be friend cause my foes die five times
 The good kid from the mad city
 Holding a cereal box instead of a Glock
 In a 1992 Cadillac that I got from my pops
 Transmission slipping, but I ain't tripping, swallow my pride
 Pop in my tape and roll the window, down
 Like Stacie homie when airing out endo
 I wish a nigga would
 A yes yes y'all, and you don't stop
 A yes yes y'all, and you don't stop
 A yes yes y'all, and you don't stop
 Kendrick, show these muh'fuckers how we rock
 A yes yes y'all, and you don't stop
 A yes yes y'all, and you don't stop
 A yes yes y'all, and you don't stop
 Big Pooh, show these muh'fuckers how we rock
 Yo, it's evident, I'm evidently your favorite
 All I ask, open your ears and please savor it
 The taste is un-acquired, quietly, been inspired
 I'm at a point in my life when I was getting tired
 Now I'm brushing off the dust
 We don't need no water, fire burned it to the dust
 Nigga grind hard, roaches turning into musk
 People hear his pain, I consider that a plus
 I'm a grown man, so a few I have trust to Do the Right Thing
 The Spike thing, consider me the in-between
 The new regime taking over
 Either we each other's opposition or you soldier
 Used to have the whole state of NC on my shoulder then I passed it
 Off to the next, you unlucky bastard
 I'm getting drunk same time every year
 To celebrate the life, Rosie no longer here
 I swear
 A yes yes y'all, and you don't stop
 A yes yes y'all, and you don't stop
 A yes yes y'all, and you don't stop
 Kendrick, show these muh'fuckers how we rock
 A yes yes y'all, and you don't stop
 A yes yes y'all, and you don't stop
 A yes yes y'all, and you don't stop
 Big Pooh, show these muh'fuckers how we rock
 Me and Big Pooh like the definition of a two-man city zoo
 Even Zeus can get beat up from punchlines
 When I kick it and pump mine, I've got to be a prophet
 I've gotta make a profit big enough to have a thirty pound wallet
 I'm a Hub City representer, so I've got to represent the
 City like a District Attorney beatin' the case for killers
 Might walk around in gurney, this is my sickest winter
 Since I had the flu and flew in the hospital with the shivers
 UPS, I deliver
 Little brown boy get the pick of the litter
 No glitter, all guts, no glory
 Station on repeat, they retread the same story
 New niggas bore me, tryna progress to that old shit
 Have a plate, that food for your soul tip
 Drill it in your head, youngun it's that real
 Hip-hop along 'fore you get your little ass whipped
 A yes yes y'all, and you don't stop
 A yes yes y'all, and you don't stop
 A yes yes y'all, and you don't stop
 Kendrick, show these muh'fuckers how we rock
 A yes yes y'all, and you don't stop
 A yes yes y'all, and you don't stop
 A yes yes y'all, and you don't stop
 Big Pooh, show these muh'fuckers how we rock",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"https://hw-img.datpiff.com/m9537590/Kendrick_Lamar_Kendrick_Lamar-front.jpg

Let Me Be Me,Kendrick Lamar,,14,7:20,,EP,1,31 Dec 09,15,"Everybody, just clap your hands if you're real
 Middle finger up, give a fuck how they feel
 Be yourself, just show me you're real
 Middle fingers up
 Just let me be me
 That's the only way I know
 Just let me be me
 That's the only way I know
 That's the only way I know how to hold it down
 That's, that's the only way I know how to hold it down
 I just wanna be me
 No disrespect, but motherfuck you
 My education stopped at a high school degree
 But I can outsmart any high IQ
 Draped in some fly shit, call me Jeff Goldblum
 Cold, my style making my nose run
 Oh, I stare at the mirror then realize, that real lies within me
 Some say I'm crazy cause I think like I need a shrink
 Ask too many questions about the stars and Earth shit
 Rather be in the studio than out buying drinks
 So if I'm not clubbing, don't think I'm on some jerk shit
 And California on that jerk shit
 But I'd just rather 2-step, like my first steps
 Jill Scott on my iPod, as my head rests
 Yes
 Just let me be me
 That's the only way I know
 Just let me be me
 That's the only way I know
 That's the only way I know how to hold it down
 That's, that's the only way I know how to hold it down
 And yeah I know I'm from Compton, Cali
 But I don't lace up Chucks or rock tan khakis
 And skinny jeans ain't quite the lick
 I probably would wear 'em but my dick don't fit
 Ha ha ha, I like to joke, got a sense of humor?
 Still face, play me short like an oompa loompa
 You ain't gotta screw up your face in front of the kids
 Won't you lighten up like Michael did?
 I grew up with killas man, people who killed men
 But my character never could be like them, man
 And they respect that, say that I'm real man
 Not a fake person, that's the Sims man
 Live my life through some film, man
 I ain't acting out shit, I be packing out shows
 Cause they know that they don't know Kendrick fo' sho
 And oh
 Just let me be me
 That's the only way I know
 Just let me be me
 That's the only way I know
 That's the only way I know how to hold it down
 That's, that's the only way I know how to hold it down
 Almost lost my life to the industry
 Had to look through a photobook to remember me
 These label heads ain't nothing but bullshit
 Have you with professional killas, chasing hits
 Lying to yourself, all over an image
 Making records they want, that was wrecking my brilliance
 My Mama said, ""Boy, that don't sound like you.""
 I said, ""This is the sound, though.""
 My only excuse
 Quite frankly, dusted off my shoes with my hankie
 And kicked it like he skate, make these motherfuckers hate me
 The reason why they hate, cause these motherfuckers ain't me
 And you can underrate me, but I know what I'm worth
 A diamond in God's dirt, a diamond in winter
 Watch the Simpsons and eating some cereal for dinner
 See I give you my life, to mix it up in a blender
 To make sure that you feel me
 Just let me be me
 That's the only way I know
 Just let me be me
 That's the only way I know
 That's the only way I know how to hold it down
 That's, that's the only way I know how to hold it down
 Kendrick Lamar, what are you trying to say?
 What are you trying to accomplish Kendrick Lamar?
 Kendrick Lamar. what are you trying to say?
 What are you trying to accomplish Kendrick Lamar?
 Kendrick Lamar, is this really you?
 Is this who you are? What are you trying to say?
 What are you trying to accomplish Kendrick Lamar?
 Kendrick Lamar, who are you?
 What are you trying to accomplish Kendrick Lamar?
 Kendrick Lamar, What are you trying to say?
 What are you trying to accomplish Kendrick Lamar?
 I think that I finally reached the pinnacle
 Of finding myself as an individual
 The world is so typical
 I just wanna be higher than that
 I used to want to be the messiah of Rap
 Infatuated with becoming a relevant star
 Trying to say goodbye to the glamorous chains and cars
 That I never had, but wrote it in my raps to make you mad
 Vanity, they say that it can damage me
 So do I really want it?
 If I didn't, I guess I'm a cool cocaine connect
 That means I'll be frontin'
 Cooking in a laboratory, hoping I can tell a story
 That the whole world can feel, like the ones that came before me
 Knowing that I'm misunderstood
 So I gotta get my point across like a snitch would
 And I would never walk in the shadow that never was really there
 Or try to fill the shoes of an invisible pair
 And Dave said he proud of my newfound honesty
 And all I could say is, ""Will the radio care?""
 Yeah, or should I say no?
 Or should I just stop and come with a whole new approach?
 You heard my hip-hop when I was sixteen years old
 Well that was me then, now I'm an adult
 Twenty-two, like the smallest of guns that you know
 Most determined, but with the smallest of funds to show
 But I'm not worried
 My talent should take me places I've never been
 The world should turn as soon as my records spin
 I wanna be the highest, on top of all the bullshit
 The negative you bring, the stress, the violence
 The capital punishment, the loud police sirens
 Too focused, one word, righteous
 And this is Kendrick Lamar, and soon y'all know Cloud 9, ya'll
 That means I wanna be the highest
 Too focused, one word, righteous
 That means I wanna be the highest
 Too focused, one word
 Too focused, too focused, one word
 Too focused, too focused, one word
 Too focused, too focused, one word
 Too focused, one word
 Too focused, too focused, one word",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"https://hw-img.datpiff.com/m9537590/Kendrick_Lamar_Kendrick_Lamar-front.jpg

Determined,Kendrick Lamar,,15,4:31,,EP,1,31 Dec 09,15,"I want to describe my discovery in the simplest terms possible
 Because it will reveal to you why it is true
 That’s whatever the mind can deceive and believe
 The mind can achieve
 Regardless of how many times you may have failed in the past
 Or off day your aims and hopes may be
 Go getter, with no cheddar
 Just a white tee and a swap meet sweater
 My life is likely to see great endeavors
 But I can't win if I can't get it together
 What I gotta do in order to see success?
 Having the world's best to call me the best?
 Pull up at the Grammy awards as the best dressed
 With an address linked to a beautiful actress?
 A dollar and a dream, I feel J. Cole
 Word to the hole in my pocket and the hoes
 That don't wanna fuck with a broke nigga with ambition
 But the last time I checked, y'all was broke bitches
 Make a name for myself then bubble like the ass of Buffy
 When she wearing a tight belt
 The homies on the block can say whatever they say
 I don't wanna be a killer, I wanna be a Gates
 In time, it'll come
 Just stay focused and humble, my son
 Show and prove, prove you're the one
 It's not about who is dopest
 Who wants it the most
 So just go out and get it
 Go out and get it
 Go out and get it
 Go out and get it
 What I gotta do in order to see success?
 Having the world's best to call me the best
 Pull up at the Grammy awards as best dressed
 With an address next to a beautiful actress
 Do I gotta run in your spot and start blastin'
 Better yet, rob the nearest Nix Check Cashing
 Ear hustle on a nigga that's constantly braggin'
 Catch him at the light, snatch him out his Jeep wagon
 Or maybe I gotta hook up with Jose
 Cop 5 bricks of the yay, head to the Bay
 Area or carry the birds to VA
 Let the Clipse distribute the work all day
 Then come back home
 Every three weeks flip three to six zones
 Homies on the block can say whatever they want
 I don't wanna be a dealer, I wanna be a Trump
 Donald, that is
 In time, it'll come
 Just stay focused and humble, my son
 Show and prove, prove you're the one
 It's not about who is dopest
 Who wants it the most
 So just go out and get it
 (And when I do I do it again
 Then I go back
 When I do I do it again
 Then I go back
 Thug it out)
 Go out and get it
 (But for now I'mma go head and doug it out
 I gotta rhyme, rhyme)
 Go out and get it
 Go out and get it
 So welcome to the story of my life
 See I'm tryna get to get right off the shit that I write
 Make a fortune, buy some Porsches for my momma and my wife
 Pops engine in this old school run tiiight!
 But as you listening to K-D-O-T
 Man, me and my girl split the bucket of KFC
 She listening to Drake and all I can say is ""Damn
 These niggas that much better than me, baby?""
 I don't think this is meant to be
 Cause I'm always losing self esteem
 She paused the iPhone then said, ""Huh?""
 I repeated what I said then she replied, ""Shut up.""
 You know you the best boy, you gotta keep doing it
 But don't forget when you do, just keep you in it
 And never listen to what the industry say
 Don't be a typical artist, be more like Jay
 Russell, Barry Gordy, Quincy Jones, Bob Johnson, Sean Combs, L.A. Reid
 Young black entrepreneurs did what it took to succeed, yeah
 So I gotta see success, I gotta make it off them Rosecrans steps
 Rising to the top like a soda shook up
 'Bout to pop, and I'll pop on whoever's in my way
 Go out and get it
 Go out and get it",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"https://hw-img.datpiff.com/m9537590/Kendrick_Lamar_Kendrick_Lamar-front.jpg

Intro (Hova Song),Y.H.N.I.C. (Hub City Threat: Minor of the Year),,1,1:59,,Mixtape,1,2003,11,"Greetings people
 You're now rockin' with the best
 Hub City's threat
 Minor of the year
 K-Dot
 I know the hood's been waitin', right
 I'mma stop being stingy
 I'mma share with y'all
 Whoever thought young Kendrick would spit so ignorant
 Make street disciples go and get a membership
 Streets revival like Creflo Dollar hustlin' on the strip
 This is church
 Advise you to purchase it or copy the worst
 Y'all rhymes sloppy, I rhyme properly
 I jam pack Monopoly dollars by puttin' 100% in every verse
 Add 10% more and what do you get
 A skinny nigga manipulatin' the innocent
 I have no sense, ever since the Rodney King riots
 Mind militant, nigga don't try it
 Try to hold the peace, for I promote violence
 Y'all don't rap
 Y'all make a lotta noise like sirens
 So I'm here to shut shit down
 The four pound decorate your city
 Make over your town
 I'm not Diddy, but still a bad boy
 'Til the reaper come get me, follow me now
 Where no man has stepped, no man has repped
 No man can withstand all the nights I've slept
 Under my sheets, no life, thinkin' 'bout death
 Fuckin' with me, you just might lose your breath
 I'll take you to them pearly gates
 Them golden streets
 Plus a cute little casket so your body can sleep
 The Hub City shit is me
 Do you believe
 It's Kendrick the God",Yes,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"https://hw-img.datpiff.com/m79565ae/Kendrick_Lamar_Hub_City_Threat_Minor_Of_The_Year-front.jpg

What the Deal,Y.H.N.I.C. (Hub City Threat: Minor of the Year),,2,2:50,,Mixtape,1,2003,11,"Uh-huh, yeah
 You know what it is
 It's that Compton shit nigga
 Get back
 If I gotta ride
 Then you's gonna die
 I hope niggas ain't really tryin' to break my bones
 Cause if you are make sure you know a nickname you want for that tombstone
 Play hard as a rock bullets can break stones
 Break bad boys down like Jenny did Sean Combs
 I'm hot as an oven you just a pressin' comb
 I'm not impressed homes you should've stayed home
 And prayed that rooftop blocked you from gettin' shitted on
 I gives a fuck if A&R's don't pick up the phone
 I swear there's no one like me but if there is then I gotta long lost twin or they made me a clone
 I don't care about friends I was made to be on my own
 I came in this world by myself and I'm leavin' alone
 Hopefully with a crib that I can call my own
 With a backyard the size of the fuckin' Georgia Dome
 Pop you popped shit and I might pop your dome
 Give your homies a reason to make a memory song
 Niggas swear that they love when the beef is on
 Knowin' that plummet time the only time he'll roam
 You better hold your breath I give you workin' death
 And recommend the gun be your chaperone
 I know young niggas that look up to Al Capone
 And they look seventeen but I swear that their mind is grown, shit
 I'm so grown and the reason why I write this way
 Pac and Big be ghostwritin' my songs
 You can play the boss but if you get shot
 From bein on top then homie that's your loss
 I'm nice wit it
 I'll pop your man then leave some money on him so it can pay for his funeral costs, get it?
 The niggas tryin' to get money like Fort Knox
 Either from the rap shit or back down to the cut rock
 And you can play a baller but deep inside you know you just an actor
 Yeah, somethin' like Rick Fox
 You ain't a thug homie you just a fox
 In the midst of werewolves somewhere in the boondocks
 And I'm really from the streets
 So if I ask for beef homeboy don't bring me no pork chop
 I turn your skin to pork homie with one chop
 With a rusty switchblade that's dirty like bum socks, heh
 They say the flow is crack
 So wherever I rap best believe you can call it a dope spot, bitch
 I swear if I gotta ride (You know what it's)
 Then you's gonna die",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"https://hw-img.datpiff.com/m79565ae/Kendrick_Lamar_Hub_City_Threat_Minor_Of_The_Year-front.jpg

Compton Life,Y.H.N.I.C. (Hub City Threat: Minor of the Year),,3,6:13,,Mixtape,1,2003,11,"Uh, oh, y'all know what it is
 Uh, it's that Compton—ish
 Chevy lights, women you like
 Husslin' nights, (yeah)
 Rollin' dice, gangsta rights
 Hood advice, (right)
 Chevy lights, women you like
 Husslin' nights, (ad lib)
 Rollin' dice, gangsta rights
 Hood advice, (let's go)
 I'm back at it again
 My city back at it with ‘em
 Back against the wall, K-Dot, they tryna pin
 But they can fuck with that pen
 The shit I write is brighter than blue gems, uh
 You better stay in that gym
 Exercise your mind till it's strong enough
 To fuck with mine
 Stick to my roots like Black Thought and 'em
 I'm black with thoughts of Einstein
 One word describing him, genius
 What you know about the city I live in
 With the souls of the dead is livin'
 You don't know about our living conditions
 We live righteously, we can give a fuck about your opinion
 But it's more than just weed and women, gangsters, husslers
 Bullet collisions, players , pimps
 Who can envision the place where I reside
 Where Eazy was pitchin', Dre was 6'4 lifting
 NWA had mention, Quik had the turn tables mixin'
 The first ones to say fuck the system
 I'm tryin to tell you about
 Chevy lights, women you like
 Husslin' nights, homie that's Compton life
 Rollin' dice, gangsta rights
 Hood advice, homie that's Compton life
 Chevy lights, women you like
 Husslin' nights, homie that's Compton life

 Hood advice, homie that's Compton life
 Geah, his own street like concrete
 Would best describe fit his gutter
 But see I'm what's underneath
 A young gun but not like your Young Chris and Neef
 I'm from the land of organized crime
 Disorderly peace
 ‘Cause nowadays niggas hustle when they order their piece
 And worship their gun the same as their religious beliefs
 The Compton shares can't forget the police
 ‘Cause in the hood tellin pigs no more
 It be the mark of the beast
 And their main aim is just the talk of the streets
 But when you see ‘em please be quick on your feet
 That they go , watch 'em
 Had you for road kill just like a possum
 You could contain ‘em
 But there's no way that you can stop ‘em
 Niggas plant their seeds to be gangstas
 Hoping one day they blossom
 The same time, hope the system don't lock ‘em
 ‘Cause Compton raised niggas and bitches we barely got ‘em
 Unless you talk about the one with the attitude problem
 From Rosecrans to Central, Compton Centennial
 We back that's for my people it's official
 Chevy lights, women you like
 Husslin' nights, homie that's Compton life
 Rollin' dice, gangsta rights
 Hood advice, homie that's Compton life
 Chevy lights, women you like
 Husslin' nights, homie that's Compton life
 Rollin' dice, gangsta rights
 Hood advice, homie that's Compton life
 I don't know if he new around here
 Ye it's good to know somebody if you're new around here
 ‘Cause it ain't too safe for you to cruise around here
 Niggas stick to your ass like glue around here
 Take New Jersey and fit it shit whatever you don't care
 It ain't no magic trick if they make your shit disappear
 The outcome is severe, and some of this casket will last a day
 But I'm amazed cause the young boy been here for years
 I seen niggas shed blood blood tears
 Hope you not try to plan for the future niggas will mute you
 Had your door in the morning wake you up like roosters
 Introduce you to rugers
 Clock you in like Tap Judah
 A nightmare on my street, Fred Krueger where I live
 Minus the actress and the producers
 Even adolenscence will shoot you over that paper
 We get Vapors like Biz Markie but still I'm used to
 From Rosecrans to Central, Compton's Anthemia
 We back that's for my people it's official

 Husslin' nights, homie that's Compton life

 You snakes, stay far from my home
 Before I play Nelly and get my Desert Eagle on
 Aim at your belly 'til you throw up your own shit
 Thinkin' you the shit, face in the toilet
 You wanna witness the livest nigga existin'
 Then come and pay me a visit, you have to pay for admission
 I'm on my mission to conquer my competition
 My ego bigger than Jay-Z, for sure, not a maybe
 I got the streets in a frenzy, dudes in the streets, they commend me
 Don't try to creep, I got semis and best believe they will empty
 Mix the juice with the Remy got me feelin' so damn tipsy
 Just crashed in front of that Bentley, smokin' blunts the bitch with me
 She takin' shots in my gymmy, couple back shots I got plenty
 Tell her stop, she said gimme, y'all can see that I'm simply
 Go DJ—'cause that's my DJ, Dave

 You're now rockin' with the best
 Hub City's threat
 Minor of the year
 K-Dot
 Ooh, it's about to get so ugly in here
 It's about to get so ugly
 Like whoever's listening to this
 Oh man I crack myself up
 Yeah
 Oh my God man, oh my God
 We 'bout to shit on these faggots man
 Check it
 Yeah, K-Dot
 Let me get that
 First niggas used to rapping, get my attention
 Now I don't even listen
 It run through one ear and out the other
 And I don't buy niggas records for music
 I'm more interested in their album covers
 I'm a talented brotha
 Plus I move so quick it's like my brain came with a joystick
 Motherfuckers better listen when I spit
 I knock records out the park
 Homeboy I Ken Griffey a hitch, and I might Ken Griffey ya bitch
 But won't buy her shit, not even a small bag of chips
 Just give her long pipe 'til it's scrapin' her hips
 Like a waitress, the way the broad ask for the tip
 If you want, just ask for a clip
 I'll give ya those for free
 I won't charge a fee
 Just roll up on you, like cut off sleeves
 Nobody can cut off the-
 -number one rap artist
 Damn, I am the hardest
 Blowin' through Nintendo cartridges
 To Maybachin it, valet parkin' it
 Now people arguin'
 Who is better? Them or him
 Him referring to me
 Them referring to the industry
 Hands down, Jay left, now give me the crown
 Fuck later, I'm takin' it now
 Fuck haters, I'm takin' 'em down
 With the red beam, red beam, silencer, don't holler it muffle the sound
 Bark like ten rottweilers straight from the pound
 Straight for the dollas, 7, 45, the order, Impala, scrapin' the ground
 I suggest you follow, or not be smarter
 Seein' another broke tomorrow
 You can tell the way I speak begins to stutter
 First it was hard for y'all to even makin' it harder
 Ain't about money, then please don't bother
 Y'all niggas funny, talkin' bout that you run shit
 When I'm lookin' at ya like ""Who are ya?""
 Y'all niggas is gas
 And what make that bad is y'all niggas is trash
 Y'all don't wanna see me spaz
 Out, pull the gats out
 And see me blast, ouch
 You better off coppin' a pen and a pad
 Than copyin' the last rhymes I had
 And spit 'em to your homeboys 'til they all say ""You wrote that?""
 Tell 'em lies or, give 'em the facts
 It don't matter 'cause in a minute, imma be chargin' my raps
 A G for a bar, that's three 16s, plus a 8 bar hook nigga, add up that
 I charge you a verse like Dre would charge you a track
 Your whole budget, hoes love it
 But you hate it, 'cause I'm your girls favorite
 Nigga, face it, you can't walk in my shoes nor change the sides tryna replace it
 As far as rap, I spit in the Matrix
 Past reality, nigga actually, I wrote a rhyme where there was no gravity
 That's a whole 'nother planet
 For real holmes, I do damage
 Blow up ya city, even ya school campus
 Run in ya class while your doin' ya standards
 Let it blast
 One gun subtractin' ya life, now that's the basics of math
 Oh my God man let me stop spazzin' out on these niggas, b
 They have to call 9-1-1, I'm done
 Dave, you feel me man? It's real
 K-Dot man, just havin' a lil fun up here man
 It's real ugly, ya know?
 Yeah, bang, bang, let's go",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"https://hw-img.datpiff.com/m79565ae/Kendrick_Lamar_Hub_City_Threat_Minor_Of_The_Year-front.jpg

 Bang 'em
 Niggas want beef ride up
 Then Free hit ya niggas squad up, squad up
 Then my niggas squad up
 If you got trees fire it up, fire it up
 This is for the Gs, and this is for hustlas
 This is for the hustlas, now back to the Gs
 Free packed intro, tech with a muffler
 Bring it on you busters, watch you niggas flee
 He's making a killing off putting his life on ProTools
 The new school, the rap version of Aaron Jones
 The hair and bones
 To rock Jane, to cocaine, to spit game
 To get us, they get tucked
 Nigga don't get gassed up, might get blast up
 It ain't about being tough, but even in them interviews
 Every time you see me got a semi in the tuck
 Chickens at the label like leave the gat at home
 You know those Hip-Hop cops got it in for you
 They got it in for us, but they ain't bending us
 We got a infra strong enough to flip a code
 Niggas want beef ride up
 Then Free hit ya niggas squad up, squad up
 Then my niggas squad up
 If you got trees fire it up, fire it up
 This is for the Gs, and this is for hustlas
 This is for the hustlas, now back to the Gs
 Cops trying to cease my beans
 No nice clothes were caught in the morning
 Trying to crease my jeans
 I remember me as a young buck
 Trying to put work in
 Same pants for two weeks
 But I would iron the dirtiness real
 Back then the battle was urgent
 Now days you see me in the same shit
 I didn't have the detergent
 I'm riding Six and Park
 You used thought you knew like the back of your hand
 Turn around and give the glove
 So I learn to stay with you
 Cause when your wheels look like Terminator 2
 It'll turn your man into a hater, true
 Hopefully the pain will stay past then
 As what's to come, it's better that what has been
 Think about it, but if his problems keep playing, solvem'
 Joey and Freeway, still hood, still starving, nigga
 Niggas want beef ride up
 Then Free hit ya niggas squad up, squad up
 Then my niggas squad up
 If you got trees fire it up, fire it up
 This is for the Gs, and this is for hustlas
 This is for the hustlas, now back to the Gs
 My big Unc still fucking with customers
 Greyhound not in town, moving them keys
 Hoopty or V12, I'm moving them keys
 Niggas know me well, can't move me with ease
 Go in your pockets at, take all your cheese
 That's how I make my profit, rob y'all when ya sleep
 It's the black Clark Kent, Superman of this rap shit
 Play Superman when them gats spit, and them Kryptonite hollowtips
 Make you backflip, then chaperone you to a casket
 It's real
 Goddamn, there's no man like I am that can compose the skills of a genius
 I'm not Hip-Hop's future, I'm Hip-Hop's Fred Krueger
 A new nightmare, I'm right there
 With the head of Lucifer killing you demons
 God's children, what can you do to us?
 This rap shit ain't new to us
 Been real, since Mama was stroller scootin' us
 Y'all better get used to us, I'm my own scout nigga
 How you recruiting us?
 Heh, I call your bluff, they said stop
 But then the people said it wasn't enough, nigga
 Niggas want beef ride up

 Watch how K-Dot move, something not like you
 Have your gun by you, 'cause niggas will try you
 Watch how K-Dot move, something not like you
 Have your gun by you, 'cause niggas will try you
 Uh
 Who's sick as me?
 Tell the truth, bitch, nobody, and that's real
 And as far as my eyes can see
 I'm the only one fucking with me
 Myself, so put your album right back on the shelf
 And let real business get dealt
 You ladies man like Leon Phelps
 I pee on any man tryna discontinue my health
 I don't give a damn on how you feel or how you felt
 Your small mercy won't help
 When shots circle around your waist like designer belts
 I design your face, the lift ya up
 Rock niggas like Bobby Boucher, you waterboy
 What you want, weed, dope, or water, boy?
 It's right here, and y'all catch up, I move fast like light years
 Now it's back to the basics
 K-Dot's nothing to play with
 A nigga tried to test my gangsta
 I pulled out a weapon and aced it
 My grade point average at the top of the brackets
 I'm sick like a cancer patient
 Assist many players like personal agent
 Y'all as foul, clothes to fragrance
 I'm the best now
 Plus the kid married to rap, old cats need to renew ya vows
 Sit down, practice your verbs and nouns
 'Cause I'm on the verge to progressin' my words
 I'm the best you heard today, hands down
 So hand down whatever you had
 Like you been in a bag
 Put it in garbage or trash, I'm the best you had
 Ever since, oh yeah, intelligence
 K-Dot, so heaven sent",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"https://hw-img.datpiff.com/m79565ae/Kendrick_Lamar_Hub_City_Threat_Minor_Of_The_Year-front.jpg

 Feel this
 Uh, lemme shit on these niggas man
 Look homie I'm not your crip or your blood
 Homie I'm just Kendrick
 See me other than him might plead the fifth amendment
 Hard headed nigga shit all it take is an instant
 Shocked to have scored just as soft as an infant
 Say you bust your gun, but never totin' it
 You say your man is dope I think he's smoking it homie
 Why you provoking it don't mean to boast a bit
 But you can call me a fly cause your boy be on some shit
 Pussy fly so all the girlies think I'm the shit
 I've got it to spend but still never buy them shit
 You better guard your bitch
 ‘Cause all it takes is a finger to turn her on holmes
 Something like a lightswitch
 Hands down but still dark think I might switch the Jag for the Porsche
 ‘Cause it got a better steering grip
 Young but been a man and you won't understand
 Spree wheels looking like a bed room ceiling fan
 When the beef start cooking
 And the shots start coming
 Don't hesitate to pop that thing
 People start looking
 And people start running
 Don't hesitate to pop that thing
 Rolling down Rosecrans
 I fear no man
 I be God damned
 If I live on my knees I rather die on my feet
 That Hub City Threat shit is me
 (Nigga) I'm from the land where fiends fly like Peter Pan
 And the average man got a heat up in his dickie pants
 I got some plans, to stack riches
 Own 76s like a Philadelphian
 You don't know but now I'm focused like camera lens
 And if I know your mans I might give a second chance
 ‘Cause I don't wanna hurt you
 Have ‘em running in herzels
 Shells stick to his back like a ninja turtle
 Crack sells, drug sell all in the virtue
 Been an artist since Prince played in Color Purple
 Weed smoke hydro blow on that purple
 2 straps on my side like suspenders on Urkel
 I suspend they murk you, what you lying for?
 You know you ain't eating like feed the children commercials
 Man my children circle around your block
 Let out shots and be home 30 minutes before they curfew
 When the beef start cooking
 And the shots start coming
 Don't hesitate to pop that thing
 People start looking
 And people start running
 Don't hesitate to pop that thing
 Rolling down Rosecrans
 I fear no man
 I be God damned
 If I live on my knees I rather die on my feet
 That Hub City Threat shit is me
 It's real
 Kendrick
 See me in the streets man
 Come to me as a man, man
 It's real nigga
 Kendrick
 You gotta respect it
 Niggas respect me man (K-Dot)
 Stop being some yank nigga
 It's real
 Lotta niggas tryna play gangsta, huh
 It's 2004 man
 You up in this shit quit it
 Be yourself man
 Still affiliated
 Niggas respect me, bitch",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"https://hw-img.datpiff.com/m79565ae/Kendrick_Lamar_Hub_City_Threat_Minor_Of_The_Year-front.jpg

One Shot Kill,Training Day,,1,3:10,,Mixtape,2,30 Dec 05,26,"One shot kill, one shot kill hey
 One shot kill, hey, one shot kill
 One shot kill go!
 (Pump up the volume)
 (Pump up the volume)
 I say, thinkin' of a master plan
 Motherfucker, I'm a mastermind
 I'm an eighteen-year-old dollar sign
 I'm a one-man tragedy, I'm Columbine
 I'm sharp as fuck but no porcupine
 Penitentiary blade to cut yo' ass up
 Good-lookin' hunk
 Lookin' for anybody thats lookin' for me
 Shotty look 'em right in the eye
 What do I see?
 A scared nigga waitin' to die
 A scared nigga, I even got you a suit and tie
 Something suitable
 Sledge hammer break down your nail cuticles
 Nigga, I do the unusual
 Torture
 Anything is necessary in the art of war
 Slam his head inside the suicidal doors
 Do him like li'l man off Players Club
 Roll around till his knees rub
 Shit
 I'm a ground hog
 No, I'm a young hog
 Hoggin' up all the money from all a y'all
 It's funny how all y'all wanna be my associates
 Come around, smile, like that shit is appropriate
 I'ma put it to your skullcap and open it
 Leave it on the side with that ho you was rollin' with
 I'm rollin' with the nine millimeter close to my nuts and dick
 You know who you fuckin' with?
 I'm done with regular bowel movements
 I'm on some other shit
 I'm a fuckin beast, you a fuckin' bitch
 I'ma fuck your bitch
 Then send her back to you
 Let her suck some dick, then let her kiss on you
 Now, ain't that a bitch?
 That ain't right, but that’s my life
 If you don’t like then we gon’ fight
 Psyche—you gon’ be fightin' a bullet
 (Pump up the volume)
 (Pump up the volume)
 Where the pump at?
 Thinkin' of a master plan
 Mothafucker, I'm a mastermind
 I'm a eighteen-year-old dollar sign
 I'm a one-man tragedy, I'm Columbine
 Shit, you already know what I'm about
 Keep the guns by the couch in the living room
 Company act up, we give it to them
 Send it to them like emails
 Let them sell his soul
 Put his body on retail
 If we do dirt and you tell
 We gon’ put you under dirt
 He was a good person
 He was down to earth but now he down to earth
 Chillin' with the worms and the insects, his brother gon’ be next
 His mother gon’ be after him, kill the family tree
 If they fuckin' with him and that ""him"" is me
 And that limb is lost on your body
 Aiming at your feet, probably
 Training day
 Sniper music
 Sniper music
 One shot kill

Blame God,Training Day,,2,3:18,,Mixtape,2,30 Dec 05,26,"Been ready
 Jay, I been ready
 HOV, I been ready
 They say patience
 Everybody wanna know why my game plan so strong
 'Cause I ain't gotta think with a light bulb on
 Nigga I eat, sleep, and shit rap; I never relax, been a busybody since I was born
 ""Is he really fucking with Sean?""
 I reply, ""His pick, I would take a tool on.""
 Dolce brown nigga, I'm right now, you ain't gotta wait later
 Where the CD at? Put it in the disc player
 Tell ho ride to it, I do it like none other
 K-Dot, definition of a young motherfucker with a problem
 ""Future of the West Coast"" I am
 And that's real tough
 Southern California, Angels, AKA LA Sharks
 Make comparisons when I seen him duck
 Man you think ""What was to Pac and Big, before?""
 And that was before
 I picked up a pen, and when I did, my thumb and my index sore
 And then I started writing with it
 Found that it flows better, like a Venice Beach sea shore
 He don't wear the same clothes as ya'll
 He is cut from a different cloth
 Ya boy is cool, but I'm a different frost
 Like igloo, every time I come off
 Every time I take off
 Pandemonium when I take off
 They hanging on the wing of that G4
 30,000 feet and still won't fall
 Why you do that for?
 Why you had to sell out that store
 You made my record sales come up short
 My reply is that it ain't my fault
 Blame God
 I can't wait when its my time (I'm coming)
 No I take that back, cuz' I got time (I'm coming)
 I know that patience is virtue
 But that being said, you got time before I hurt you
 No lie (No lie)
 I can't wait when its my time (My time)
 No I take that back, cuz' I got time (Got time)
 I know that patience is virtue
 But that being said, you got time before I hurt you
 No lie (No lie)
 When the lights get dark
 And every body quiet, know its my part
 I might start a riot
 The main event
 Bulletproof under that black tent, you can't shoot through shit
 I never played the bench
 Star Point Guard
 Never pass up money, I'm a ball hog
 Touch anything I get my hands on, into pushin' like Ray Charles
 I never had no flaws
 ""Ooos"" and ""Ahhs"" after every bar
 Take your bitch, then give her back
 For no reason for, just because, y'all actin hard
 I'm bein myself
 And I got some plastic under my belt, so rest assured
 You don't want your moms thinkin' bout pullin' that hospital cord
 Went from a Honda Accord, to a Bentley Azure
 Back seat got a flock of broads
 And I ain't gotta say to kiss it, just like ""Sure""
 Momma gon' clean or fix it
 Use terrific, Easter brum
 All it need is a little season on
 Who said a veteran can't be so young?
 I sound better than half ya'll on
 Damn K-Dot, let me see your arm
 I ain't gotta do a show, my jewels perform
 I ain't gotta do a show, my jewels perform
 Princess cut looks stupid dumb
 Eyes close shut, all I see is dollar signs
 And I won't get enough 'til I'm layed in the grave or hand cuffed up bout one time
 No lie
 Blame God
 I can't wait when its my time (I'm coming)
 No I take that back, 'cause I got time (I'm coming)
 I know that patience is virtue
 But that being said, you got time before I hurt you
 No lie (No lie)
 I can't wait when its my time (My time)
 No I take that back, cuz' I got time (Got time)
 I know that patience is virtue
 But that being said, you got time before I hurt you

Who Shot Ya,Training Day,,3,2:49,,Mixtape,2,30 Dec 05,26,"I welcome y'all to boot camp
 Training Day
 Fasten your seatbelts
 Who shot ya, I don't know but you're best to call a doctor
 Make sure them rookie medical surgeons can oper-rate on you
 Pistol whip break the face on you, shit I does it my way like Sinatra
 Let them infrared's Dalmatian dot ya
 Scope'll spot ya, move wrong and I got ya
 Through my vision like perennial
 Creepin' to your house, you hear footsteps slowly as I tippy-toe
 The tip I owe is through your window pane, I'm insane
 One shot could leave 'em senseless, Marlon Wayans
 Psychiatrist can't restrain the mind of a sick patient
 Spray everything, not a single bullet wasted
 Be patient, you gon' be meeting mad links
 Put 'em in the basement
 BET, I'm strapped with TNT
 Follow rules every morning, this bitch coming with me, ooh
 That's what they say when they see me in your coupe
 Sunroof, rims spinning like a fucking hoola-hoop
 You tried to play big and say ""gimmie the loot""
 Tables turned, now the people saying ""please don't shoot""
 Get out the way, lady, and try to make it to safety
 Cause I doubt that my shit is on safety
 Spray niggas, no ifs, ands, buts, or maybes
 Ride shotgun, 745 Maybe
 That's Maybach for you dumb motherfuckers
 I'm wise like my pops but I'm young, motherfucker
 I'm the one, motherfucker, bust around hustlers
 You want it? They could serve you, butler
 Excuse me Ma, I ain't going for your lover
 So when I fuck you, the same time I'm like ""fuck you""
 You're better off looking for your next sucker
 Money talks, I thought you heard Chris Tucker
 I ball as if I play for the Rucker
 Black Widow, keep something under my pillow to buck ya
 He talk about it and when the fifth touch ya, no confession, no Usher, for real
 Your whole spot is a movie like Blockbuster
 If I want you imma bring it to your block, busta
 And make it clap, no I'm not spliff star and busta
 In fact, my niggas is linemen the way they rush ya
 I keep it street from Compton to Russia
 Rhyme technique is something like none other
 It's warfare, choke if you scared, go buy a flashlight and pray under your covers
 I slaughter niggas, one hand bang, Vince Carter niggas
 Young boy I'm a father figure to kids who's minds is bigger
 And they pops still sprung off the hardest liquor, I'm young
 Please move in orderly fashion
 For the love of money and crime I got a passion
 Blow your body and spine whenever I'm blastin'
 Makeover your whole face, you look like a Jackson
 Any one, pick one
 Aye
 I told you we gonna send you niggas to boot camp
 Training Day
 Fasten your seatbelts
 The ride is rough
 Lace your boots too
 This is practice right here, we do this shit in our sleep

Good Morning America,Training Day,,4,4:05,,Mixtape,2,30 Dec 05,26,"Good morning, America (Ahh)
 (Wake up, wake up, wake up)
 The saga continues
 Good morning, America (Ahh)
 (Wake up, wake up, wake up)
 'Cause as the gold Daytons spin
 (Wake up, wake up, wake up)
 A new revelation
 Good morning, America (Ahh)
 Good morning, America
 A new day, we gotta hit the schedule ahead of us
 The letter K-D-O-T, add a space like a Microsoft keypad
 You can't see me, invisible ski mask
 Poke the eyes out my beanie
 Ghetto Zorro on the headlines, I leave
 Feces, shit on niggas, nigga
 My flow come in plural
 Multiple of it, majority love it
 I got the masses, meaning societies, public
 Low Dickie shorts, L.A. fashion still holding grudges
 Ain't forgot y'all killed Pac, niggas
 Ain't forgot y'all left the West Coast for dead
 Tried to play it off like the paramedics was coming
 Instead, we dusted off, pulled the bullet out our heads
 Left a permanent scar for the whole world to recognize
 California, economics, pay your taxes bitch
 It's a new day
 New chronic, new hundred spoke, new six tray
 New Snoop, new 2Pac, new Doc Dre
 A new West Coast to wake up to, Nate
 Good morning, America
 As a new day begins, the saga continues
 A new breeze stepping in
 I hope that you're ready
 'Cause as the gold Daytons spin, brings forth new life
 A new revelation (The second coming is here)
 Show you right
 Oh, you done fucked up, baby
 Young Kendrick, the grown up baby
 On enough to acknowledge your fuck ups
 Maybe I spare your life, maybe I won't
 Maybe I give you the funk
 Geroge Clinton, bring my sentence like I got a English major in it
 This is higher academics, pay attention, students
 Niggas, what was you foolin' with a handgun?
 Might as well have a harpoon, then
 I carry two or more with me like I'm carpoolin'
 We mobb deep when it's beef
 I don't say ""get 'em,"" I say ""move in""
 S.W.A.T. team so aggressive, turn a minor problem extreme
 Kool-Aid red beam on top of my weapon
 Notice my professionalism, I'm perfecting my craft
 You niggas is half doin' your job, insubordination
 I'mma have the boss get you fired
 Oh, I am the boss
 Get terminated, bitch
 It's a new day
 New chronic, new hundred spoke, new six tray
 New Snoop, new 2Pac, new Doc Dre
 A new West Coast, don't wake up too late
 Good morning, America
 As a new day begins, the saga continues
 A new breeze stepping in
 I hope that you're ready
 'Cause as the gold Daytons spin, brings forth new life
 A new revelation (The second coming is here)
 Show you right
 The moral is try your best to not collide with the best of 'em
 I ain't talkin' 'bout you, I talk about Jay, Nas, and Em
 Crème de la crème, homie
 Pockets fat, hand boney
 How is that?
 Kinda ironic, the West Coast, I underline it
 Make him my priority, in orderly fashion, I ain't livin' in
 Nobody lasted in time, nobody closing your blinds
 The sun is shining, bitch
 It's a new day
 New chronic, new hundred spoke, new six tray
 New Snoop, new 2Pac, new Doc Dre
 A new West Coast, don't wake up too late
 Good morning, America
 As a new day begins, the saga continues
 A new breeze stepping in
 I hope that you're ready
 'Cause as the gold Daytons spin, brings forth new life
 A new revelation (The second coming is here)
 Show you right
 My nigga, hahahaha
 Roll your window down, start there
 Ahahaha
 See, you gotta hear the street
 You gotta be snortin', you know
 You gotta taste that shit, feel that
 Learn that shit, brotha
 Learn that shit, that shit will get you killed
 These mothafuckas plottin' all kinds of shit behind your back

Blow Them Horns,Training Day,,5,4:00,,Mixtape,2,30 Dec 05,26,"Bear witness
 Watch me get it in like underage club attendants
 The roof go back like it's vintage
 The young boy's back to burn your village, the fire touching the ceiling burn
 What's God willing when HOVA retired?
 Now he back, guess he got some competition on his hands
 Who is that? I...am...
 K-Dot, I'm claustrophobic don't put me in the box with you niggas
 You can't categorize me
 I'm already convinced that I'm the hottest nigga out
 Any comments? I thought so
 You niggas is gassed up like ALCO
 Scared to play Madden on All-Pro
 Step your game up
 I'm here to fuck up niggas' barcodes
 SoundScan'll never read your albums again (whoo!)
 I take 99.9% of your fans
 The last one left is your moms (and she even iffy about you...)
 Ain't nothing gifted about you
 Put a bullet in you, tell a doctor get it up out you
 I'm 'bout to, send him right there, he shark food
 Piranhas is coming I put beat on you rap dudes
 I don't wait on you rap dudes
 Nigga NASA couldn't reach my altitude
 Sky's the limit, and your body ain't airborne...
 Is it? Are you?
 My real niggas, once again it's on
 'Til we load the ammo and drop the bomb
 I kick up destruction and when I'm done
 My city blow them horns, it sounds like...
 (Whoo-ee!)
 When they blow dem horns I'm coming
 Torch in hand, yes, I'm running
 I told Jay Rock, I like red too
 But you gotta kill these niggas out the blue
 They don't see it coming
 Who ain't a part of the family tree
 Do 'em like Paul Bunyan, axe about him
 We travel like an ant colony, you can't count us
 Sip Henny 'til my throat drown
 New Benz, no malice
 Count money 'til our hands get calloused
 40 caliber in the Cavalier, welcome to Los
 Angeles, you might leave with bandages
 Real life, no mannequin
 You pull out, no panicking, you better shoot
 Or have something fall on your rooftop, no raindrops
 I'm talking 'bout gold bullets and black suits
 No magician, no magic, poof
 Closed casket fatal attraction
 Son, three hit you like John Paxson, I ain't bull-shitting
 Them veterans been loved 'em
 Talk about bars I got a life sentence of 'em
 And I'm just like spitting cousin, ciao
 No man get the best of him
 The way I see, why rap?
 I'm just wasting my breath
 Y'all don't hear me
 I'm just chasing my death
 It's all over, the end's here so I'm pacing my steps
 Try not to recollect what I know
 These pregnant quotes meaning, they give life like semen
 Be the reason my heart's bleeding
 I'm coughing up blood in my palms as I recite the book of Psalms
 Over a slow clap and kick drum, wis-dom
 The application of your knowledge is me
 Pay your tuition, this verse is like a college degree
 Y'all don't hear me, y'all fear me like a doomsday prophet
 When I'm focused, nothing under the moon can stop it
 I leave you off the Earth's surface, that's what you get
 For trying to test my patience like nurses
 This ain't a verse this is a Kennedy curse
 Put your brain on your lady's purses, you niggas crazy
 My real niggas, once again it's on
 'Til we load the ammo and drop the bomb
 I kick up destruction and when I'm done
 My city blow them horns, it sounds like...
 (Whoo-ee!)
 When they blow dem horns I'm coming
 Torch in hand, yes, I'm running
 My real niggas, once again it's on
 'Til we load the ammo and drop the bomb
 I kick up destruction and when I'm done

G'z and Hustlerz,Training Day,,6,3:43,,Mixtape,2,30 Dec 05,26,"What I look like, a sucker to you, nigga?
 Fuck you, rookie
 Somethin' incredible, heh-heh-heh
 Hey, hey, hey, hey
 Turn that shit up, boy, bump that shit
 Nigga, hold a handgun and dump that shit
 Nigga, buy that borough and fuck that bitch
 And kick her out before the sun come up
 Nigga, my funds is up
 I got my money right
 Business movin' like New York City lights
 Bitches all over that boy
 Cause they know that young boy got a cold strut
 But I don't fuck with them hood rats, they'll set you up
 And I ain't goin' out just like that
 I'd rather go out over a shoot-out, plow
 Land of the scandalous, every corner got a candle lit
 Every stop sign got a hollow tip
 Every sunshine got a hood under it
 And you know we Marilyn Jones runnin' that shit
 My bones made out of cement, strong arm
 Explode on y'all, Vietnam, boom
 Heh-heh-heh, okay, I'm ready, ha-ha
 Tell your boyfriend to do it like this
 A thousand for the jeans, three hundred for the kicks, bitch
 I was born with diamonds in my wrist
 So, it's only right for your boy to talk shit, yuck
 Straight nasty, don't walk past me
 I just might grab it, just might pull a blade out and stab it
 I would kill it only if you say
 I'm more than willin' to take advantage
 Legs to the ceilin', ho, throw away your panties
 Tell 'em that we chillin' if your boyfriend harassin'
 I take 'em, then I perform magic
 Head on the freeway, seatbelt fastened
 And go and tell the DJ to play my shit
 You never heard nothin' like this, yuh
 The new West Coast's best-kept secret
 Chronic smoke comin' out my throat, ha-ha
 Shit, ay, ay, heh-heh, fuck it, I'm goin' in
 They say, ""Who that?"" K-Dot, no roof, new top
 They hate, they watch, speed down the block
 In a Porsche Box, stashbox, got a new Glock
 In a shoot-out with anybody that you got
 .45, no lie, no problem
 If he got his jewels on, I'm a Black Rob him
 Nigga, I'm a bad boy, I'm a black ski mask, boy
 I'm a run in his house, then ask, ""Where the cash, boy?""
 ""Tell me where the safe or this'll be the last time
 That you ever have a gun in your face""
 Might be the last time that somebody run in your place
 You picked a bad time to be at fuckin' home today, stupid
 I'm ruthless, I'm Eazy-E, I'm Snoop, shit
 I'm 2Pac, I'm inferno, I'm so hot, no chicken
 Tell it to the Colonel Sanders, do it for that Compton campus
 Heh-heh, I'm done with the fourth quarter
 Shit, psych, Rock, get 'em
 Guess who's back? Fresh new fitted, turned back
 Fresh new spinners on the 'Lac
 Never knew Rock could do it like that
 I'm a mack for real, I hit more pussy than Vagisil, yeah
 Who got this game in a chokehold?
 We'll make your best rapper submit
 Pack up and quit cause we the shit
 Plus, that Calico hold more shells than El Pollo Loco
 Turn you to a dough salt
 Take your ho to the mo-mo quick
 She want to bounce up and down on my pogo stick
 Me n' Dot spit raw, deejays, Mr. Miyagi
 Your records wax us on and wax you off, ha
 You come frontin', get slammed like Onyx
 We the West Coast classics, you better pay homage
 You want problems? The kings of the shoot-outs
 Leave your block smokin' like a luau

 Where my gangstas at? Where my dimes at?
 Where my nickels and dimes at?
 .45s MAC 10s and nines at?
 9 times out of 10 half of y'all will die in this combat
 If its 12 of you, shells bubble like Alka-Seltzer
 You wanna die? I can help you
 Put the rap beef aside and the content of the street shit to the block, parental advised
 I'm feeling like Muhammad Ali in his prime
 Mike Jordan in his heyday
 Call me Jeff Gordon in that hard top swerving in between the lines
 I'm tryna see a better way, I still feel hatred
 Uncle Bobby's still incarcerated, Grandma died in Vegas
 Grandpa moved to Mississippi
 I really can't tell if dude missed me
 Probably stretched out on the floor, with an empty bottle of whiskey next to his earlobe
 More reason why my heart cold
 Prior to a lot of hatin' going, Feds raided the studio
 We tryna do songs, but they ain't listen
 They just kick down the door as if they have permission
 Why you had to do that for?
 I wish Pro Tools was on record
 Wish I was sitting in the booth doing the chorus or something
 No assumptions, I know I'm nice
 I know I'm walking the path of greatness, no compass
 Not atheist, but the bars reside with Satan
 Chokin' the mic, releasing my frustration
 Rather do that before I catch court cases
 Locked up by Caucasians, claustrophobic
 Boxed in like a new Porsche rollin'
 Stones on my wrist, iceberg, Titanic frozen
 K-Dot's in my colon
 That nigga, Colon Powell
 Modern day war victim
 Oh, I'm foul, come join my coalition
 No snitch nigga, go join the co-defendant
 Feel relentless, new apprentice
 King of, comprehension
 No competition
 Compton's back, pump your fist like this and that
 No sumbliminals, I'm listenin', face the facts
 You're a disgrace to this rap business
 Just a one-man office, you need assistance
 Gun tucked, walk in the club, set off sensors
 I am a senseless thug, with book smarts
 And anybody wanna go at rap legends, without theirself to question
 We gave you the self-motivation to be in this profession
 Gave you the rhyme scheme before your English education
 Exclamation, put it in quotes
 I say I'm better than most that say they're the ones that gave 'em swag
 The flow, the artist development
 Am I who gave you the growth?
 You didn't bloom by yourself, somebody had to plant the seed
 The sun shine, and now king me
 The rapper's rapper, the MC's MC

 Trigger finger itching
 To trouble one of you niggas
 I'm daring one of you niggas to jump
 I'ma snatch you out pistol whip you
 Then put you back in the trunk
 Shit, I'm back in the front
 The front page of the newspaper
 They say I'm seeing more paper... true
 But only if you knew that
 I was in your house right now taking the paper from you
 Where ya safe at?
 Chick is swinging on the dick like a fucking bat
 And catch it all like an umpire
 I'ma go hard, rims bigger than the fucking car
 Baby girl say why the fuck you even got tires?
 I don't know, just get inside
 And never question my shit again ho
 I fold dough like a notebook
 I see money, you pass it up like Magic Johnson no look
 Who the fuck taught you niggas how to cook

 Holla if you hear me
 In the memory of 2Pac sincerely
 Been a G, since standing four feet on the monkey bars
 Steal a nigga's box like it was ours
 Cars roll up, Nah we don't fold up
 We just hold up our guns like championship cigars
 Mama hold the porch sipping OE out of a straw
 I remember it all, them early Compton days
 Shit, I put my all in them high school hallways
 Montgomery never saw the dime bags
 Finshed my work, finished a sale right before class was over
 Now what's over I'm old enough to put the world on my shoulders without a massage
 Never came in the truck no more, we back seat
 Times is rough, the only time your pledge your allegiance
 If you're shot in the heart bleeding
 Ouch
 It's gutter when the sun come up
 When the sun go down
 Nothing but tears, no onions
 Under the ungodly functions, 187s and robbery will come
 Don't go looking for it
 Don't look like you hard
 You're better off looking foreign, I'm warnin' ya
 Before that warm temperature warmin' up
 Your blood temperature, that corner filled with coroners
 The neighbors is listeners
 I'm the future of the new west for you visitors
 Never mind them other niggas
 I'm talkin' in particular
 Just cause you got the flu don't mean you're sick enough
 I'm igloo cold with it
 If California snows then I did it
 The 21st of June I'll make a blizzard
 The OG aim they guns at the moon
 Bullets break through the atmosphere
 Fear no man but God, the God of rap is here
 And I can see you scared (whew)
 Real gangsters either dead or in jail
 And you don't look like a zombie and I don't see no cells
 I sink niggas blackships, he won't sail
 And his album really ain't shit, he won't sell
 And I had that mind state since twelve
 No skates on my feet just running the turf for life like football cleats
 5 hours asleep, nigga you do the math
 That's 19 hours lost, I got insomnia bad
 But, I can't complain or happen to think it too much, came passion Albert Einstien gained
 Had to hold my stomach for hunger pains over looking
 This business got too many villians
 Superman is back
 The cape ain't red, it's black
 That's a trench coat
 And the note for your information if we was dead this recarnation

 I kick a funky friendly conversation that keep they mind racin'
 You can't complain about the flow I got
 I let my thoughts space out with the astronauts
 Like the white boys say, ""Pass the pot""
 Let me smoke for a minute
 As god as my witness, I never abuse this hip hop
 I'll never pretend to be something I'm not
 Giving you something to rock to other than hardcore rap, possible
 You ever been under hypnosis I mean literally
 Not being focused with your eyes open
 They say 90% of humans don't even notice
 Now can you imagine a couple of minutes passing without you knowing what happened
 Without you knowing people was laughing at you
 They say the worse scenario is when they have to catch you
 You wake up out of your mind, your whole thoughts is baffled
 You're doing things like trying to touch your shadow
 Now here's some realistic, is it something that can happen or is it just a gimmick
 You never know until your bear witness
 Bear witness...
 Bear witness...
 You woke up in the morning, took a shower
 Call some bitches over, want them to be over in one hour
 She came over, you fucked
 She left and you hopped in the truck, you
 Took your shirt off cause outside was burning up, you
 Skirted off turned your beat up but your gun was tucked
 Under the seat, you headed to Long Beach
 Hop on the 710 the carpool lane
 Only cause you got black tint and they can't see a thing
 Your check engine light popped up, its feeling like bad luck or what not
 You tried to maneuver all the way to the call box
 But one lane before you got there your car stopped
 Stop
 If your was listening for the past two minutes
 Then you just made accurate 90% hypnosis",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,https://i1.sndcdn.com/artworks-000410369286-fg3yfa-original.jpg,,,,https://soundcloud.com/kendricklamarcompton/sets/training-day-kendrick-lamar,https://www.datpiff.com/Kendrick-Lamar-K-Dot-Training-Day-mixtape.300692.html,,,,,,101,1.68,0.03,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
J. Dilla,Training Day,,15,4:01,,Mixtape,2,30 Dec 05,26,"I'm still lost in my own zone in the living room
 Like I'm dead to the world playing Donny Hathaway
 Patron shots I consume taking the pain away
 Each sip bring me closer to my doom
 Sun shining bright through the crack in the blind
 Thinking to myself this morning what happened to time
 It's passing away, the world decides, it ain't what it used to be
 Everything I love don't mean what it used to mean
 For example spitting a 16
 No thrills, feeling numb like i'm of Thorazine
 It used to be nicotine, I was addicted to this rap thing
 Now I'm just trying to trap cream
 Enough drowning in my sorrow, never put off tomorrow
 What you can do today, that's my new motto
 With that said, I roll out the bed
 Hit the showers, it's time to get this bread, now make dollars
 I woke up in the morning, washed my body, put some clothes on it
 After that, put on my heat like Alonzo Mourning
 Cause everybody got a gun, it's like they're copy cats
 So me without one is like I'm dated
 I'd be out of style like Adidas and fat laces
 Starter Jackets and dookie ropes or whatever the late '80's had favored
 I'm one of the best of my homo sapiens
 One of the best of God's creations
 He shows favoritism everytime you hear the record on radio stations
 I know you mad, you ain't gotta say much, I can feel you hating
 Serving MCs like waitress, Andre Agassi, multitalented
 Rapper slash athlete, killing these niggas, they're screaming in agony
 Half of these niggas ain't half of me
 Half of these niggas ain't talking 'bout nothing, yakity, yakity
 Pushing my buttons like plaid shirts, clapping them rapidly
 Actually, Kurt Cobain
 Ten years in my career, pray to God that I don't blow up my brains Lord, I'm here
 Great Depression, I don't know much, all I know is studio sessions, and how to get my bars up
 They call me Subway sandwich the way i give them cold cuts
 Cut from a different cloth, and these Yves Saint Laurent jeans
 They cost so much
 Usher
 Either way I'm caught up in materialistic
 Anything that's custom, best believe I'mma get it
 Getting tired of it and get rid of it, don't step on the Compton premises without your weap-on on your hip
 The home of the stray bullet that murder the innocent
 No matter the crime rate I still remain content
 Moving at my own pace, cause if it don't make dollars
 Then it really don't make sense, and if you can't comprehend
 I holler like a rottweiler behind a backyard fence
 Holla, holla, holla, holla
 I woke up this morning, counting my cash
 Girls calling me now, straight throwing the ass
 I threw on my T, I grabbed my bitch
 Laced up my chucks, rock sharp as a piece
 They used to call me a creature, but now I'm a beast
 With my voice on the beat, I'm the voice of the streets
 From my head to the feet, I'm bad to the bone
 Nigga, I won't stop, 'til I'm add to the throne
 Dog, I ride with the chrome, gotta be safe in this shit
 Call me Pharrell, boy, I keep me them Clipse
 I don't ride on no skateboard, I roll with some grinders
 Trapped in the hood, far from Giligan's Island
 I was a drug dealer, but now I'm a wild spitter
 Nigga, I'm more iller, call me a hospital
 You got the hiccups, I got this fluent as shit nigga
 I spit a bar, straight ruin your shit nigga
 Known as a mack, I can influence your bitch
 I'm the reason these niggas be handcuffin' them quick
 I'm the reason these bitch niggas be playa hating on us
 See them in the streets, these niggas don't be saying nothing
 But keep on talking, you ain't ready for beef
 Jay Rock down to bust a nigga head in the streets
 I can't help it, the hood flow through my blood
 This gangbangin shit, should be considered a drug
 Everybody doing it now, I see you rap niggas
 Wrong place, wrong time, that's how you get clapped nigga
 Raised in the projects, money my object
 They standing in my way, like a frog I dissect them
 You'll get shot walking through my section
 Now you a verse all in my session, they say life is a school
 Everyday is a lesson, well I get kicked out, shit got me guessing
 Shit naw, check my ghetto report card, straight-A student in every class up in the Gardens
 Money over bitches, nigga i'm heartless
 Money over bitch niggas, rich is my target

 The ugly ones go to Sam Cassell
 You washed up like Nick Van Exel.

 Bang. Aw fuck it let's talk more sports

 One man roster matter fact I'm the '96 Mike Piazza
 MVP of LA, call the doctor
 I came up with my assumptions I must be rap ESPN or something
 It’s about time for halftime reporting
 I’m a star kicking niggas off the field and court man
 I know you good with the right but you still ain’t nice till you do it with the left hand
 You ain’t nice till you play all positions
 Or knock it out the stadium, hey wait a min
 I got tickets to the all star game, to pro bowl game baby girl bring a friend
 I’m a get you in, I’m a take you out, I’m a stick it in
 You might say… ouch
 Just let me score one time
 Dribble my balls to the floor one time
 I’d be going for a week bet they gon’ miss me more than a pitch from Nolan Ryan
 I am the Jeff Gordon of recording
 I am Tony Hawk if I was skateboarding
 I am Michael Irv before the coke snortin'
 Aw fuck it I’m what’s ever important
 After this you gon applaud him
 If not, fuck it I’m blood sportin'
 Homie I’m blood sport
 Y’all niggas ran out of time to get y'all shit together man
 I’m here

Prototype,Training Day,,19,5:10,,Mixtape,2,30 Dec 05,26,"They say that I'm the one
 And you, you are the prototype
 You might have the ears of sound
 But you already know who they like
 You niggas need hugs for real
 Somebody to hold you real tight
 You niggas need hugs for real
 Somebody tell 'em he's the prototype
 I am the truth, no lie about it
 Bring my testimony when I walk in that booth
 Walking the thin line between love and hate, I defend mines
 Join them when it comes to their crunch time, I never fold
 I love pressure, that's why I apply so much on niggas thinking they better
 I am a clutch shooter, I am a sharp shooter
 And it's great enough to hear the butterfly moving
 Follow me moving through these ghetto streets and school I say fuck retarded sweep
 Walk into school the chief right there tried to talk at me
 In the midst of Piru and natty Blood beef
 Shall we hesitate or walk down
 That 10-grade summer we had death right in front of us
 Then leave the house without kissing our mamas
 The new Jordans came out, but we didn't get them
 Cuz the color haunt them to get too much attention
 Damn it I liked it thoughs
 Pac was talking 'bout the concrete rose
 I never seen one till I looked in the mirror
 There go, huh huh, that's the flow right there
 You should use it, that's what my conscience said then I hopefully abused it, huh
 I am the lyrics and the music, y'all rapping note for the beat
 I let the instrumentals listen to me
 I listen to heat, my ears can hear fire
 I pierce through the flame like barbed wire breaking up concrete
 And I ain't thinking 'bout no rap beef
 Niggas is getting killed throughout the week, that's every day
 Catchin' bullets like an umpire
 We tried to stay home but still ain't safe
 That's baseball tactics, retaliation back and forth like tennis rackets, we used to it
 Who can circle 'round the block the fasters
 If you can do it, think you know why it becomes a practice
 We worked it out like barely total
 'Cause shit happens
 You niggas need hugs for real
 Somebody to hold you real tight
 You niggas need hugs for real
 Somebody tell 'em he's the prototype
 I ain't even rap but let them young boys get ya
 Paint a perfect picture like I'm rhyming only scripture
 I'm nice, ice water veins, it's pure no filter
 Who you get your style from, the same real familiar like I heard it before
 But reincarnation is a blind man spirit
 So I ain't going for it, na uh
 I ain't having it, you getting to board it
 Like an unfair mother, my child you gon suffer
 To you acknowledge to whom gave you life to knowledge in Zion learning and taking deuce through college
 The prototype for the flows you like
 I'm surgical Ronald Mike, I cut you up somethin' nice
 Get out the pocket, I'm sending them skyrockets right through your minds
 Optic popping out your eye sockets, ah
 Excites a riot every time I'm rhyming
 In accordance with the snare I got impeccable time, Junior
 They say that I'm the one
 And you, you are the prototype
 You might have the ears of sound
 But you already know who they like
 You niggas need hugs for real
 Somebody to hold you real tight
 You niggas need hugs for real
 Somebody tell 'em he's the prototype",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,https://i1.sndcdn.com/artworks-000410369286-fg3yfa-original.jpg,,,,,,,,,,,310,5.17,0.09,,Yes,6,,,,,,,1,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1,,1,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1,,2,,,,,,,1,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Hard Body,Training Day,,20,3:59,,Mixtape,2,30 Dec 05,26,"That’s where you headed boy, to pine oil heaven. I'mma get that gun, and then I'mma get that money. I don’t believe you got it in you, Jake. I'mma go get it right now (gunshot) Oh shit, awwwww you motherfucker! The next one will kill you. Ohh, son of a bitch. You shot me in the ass
 I never been a bitch in my life, I never ran from a fight
 I was told when niggas bark you should bite
 And these puppies ain’t eatin' enough Pedigree to scare something
 They play with the word gangster til some lead dumpin
 Until the ambulance coming pressin' on they chest
 Calf and stomach, you grabbin' the hand of a woman
 I never took the stand, snitched on my man and came back home Like it was nothin', actin' like I ain’t do somethin' wrong
 Fuck it, and if I did i would look 'em in the face
 Tell hop out that bucket and spray
 Tell 'em to make sure they hit my head and my waist
 Tell them to circle round the block twice in case
 Shit, cement pump in my veins, hard body to the death
 Scream fuck the world with a capital F
 Everybody extinct, it’s just me and my niggas left
 And this is how we think
 No tongue tissue niggas around me
 Just a hundred cement niggas around me
 We hard bodied, y'all bodies ain’t like ours
 And if y'all bodies was then y'all be built for war
 Tell em'
 No teddy bear niggas around me
 Just a hundred cement niggas around me
 We hard bodied, y'all bodies ain’t like ours
 And if y'all bodies was then y'all be built for war
 And when I say hard body, homie, not in a physical
 You either born with it or real niggas around real kids
 And it’s passed on like a ritual, not sworn in it
 You ain’t livin' it because you put it in sentences
 And you ain’t givin' it if it’s ten percent, it gotta be a hundred
 Walkin' down the block, K in my hands, fuck it, who want it?
 I got a hundred shots for any one of you blood clots
 Motherfucker, we will fuck ya
 Spray your coupe and leave smoke in it like Chris Tucker
 I’m no gimmick, we smell out the timid
 We lift something out the trunk that got a kickstand with it
 You either fall now or stand with it
 You either crawl now or get laid down
 Think about it, I’m only giving you one minute
 Fifty-eight, fifty-nine, bloaw, you’re too late
 Motherfucker, meet your fate
 Look between my eyes
 You can see the fire burning like my Lamborghini tires
 And my burner from the four fifth which is the four five
 Which is that ninety-five Jordan shit
 Jordans on your feet, we gon' take them shits
 Put them on our feet and reshape them shits
 Now don’t they look sweet?
 Wear em for a minute, sell them the next week
 That’s good profit, y'all ain’t thinkin' logic
 You talkin' ass backwards like criss cross pockets
 Mel Gibson, you just actin'
 Lethal weapon, I take you niggas to target practice
 Teach you niggas a lesson or two
 Won’t you listen when a grown man is lecturin' you?
 Cause any weapon will do in the process of fuckin' up you, nigga
 You rappers ain’t built like us
 Y'all just lift a lot of weights and look tough
 We see through that, we shoot through anything that’s buff
 And we ain’t thinkin' about handcuffs
 The police runnin' from us, we so hard bodied, trust
 Tongue tissue ass niggas man, ay wait, we say, either go hard or go home, tha- tha- tha- that’s what we go by, either stand for something or fall for anything nigga, bite that, o- open your mouth, bite that go ahead, you’re suicidal

Grammy Fam,Training Day,,21,3:25,,Mixtape,2,30 Dec 05,26,"I don't need the hype
 They call me- fuck it- I don't need no introduction
 No ad-libbing my name 100 times for nothing
 You already know it's K-Dot, city of Compton
 Analogy is like Biggie and Bed Stuy, Oakland and 2Pac
 I'm more focused, I'm nothing like you new guys
 Struggling over a few lines thinking you hot
 Cause your homey said you you was a few times
 Which is too many times, they lying to you, they telling a lie
 The only time I lie in a booth is when I sleep in it
 Record 24 hours, you niggas better get your bars up
 I bench press this rap stuff, got it locked like handcuffs
 I threw away the key
 My cool is on, she love my A/C
 My juice is on, and I wish one of y'all try to rob me
 I shoot, and how have you laying between the sheets with the Isleys
 I push the coupe like a high speed
 The helicopters come and realize that nothing's behind me is behind me
 Your honor, I fuck over this beat with no condom
 This ain't rap it's really a porno re-winded back
 Finally the finest of 'em all is back
 To define the laws of crack
 Y'all don't obey, y'all ain't nice, y'all just OK
 You're nothing more than a little John phrase
 I'm Mike Jordan in his prime
 Modern-day Issac Hayes, theme song to Shaft
 Equivalent to the theme song to your career, study my craft
 You ignorant: I do it without a pen and pad
 Just inspiration: something you never had
 If my pockets is something you trying to grab
 I pull out the rocket and peel you back like scab
 You old news, you old dudes get out of my way
 Let the young boy come through; don't mention my age
 I'm on a mission for pay
 And you astronaut niggas just crowding my space
 You not in my atmosphere, you can act like you here
 But actually you ain't accurate fucker with this music biz
 The industry like, ""Fuck it, let the music be his""
 No theme park, I'm not trying to amuse you kids
 Small shark, jaws is here, jump in the water
 Do he really fuck with President Carter?
 My reply is that I can't stay away from the bosses
 Had the bidding war popping like an auction
 Nine or 10 labels like what he hitting for 7 zeros or more
 Remember having Aftermath sitting on my porch
 But money was barricading my door, I couldn't open it
 Money on my passenger side, now who you rolling with?
 Black diamonds, not no rose-gold shit
 Teamed up with Watt's finest
 Jay Rock won't you avalanche these niggas so I can rock-climb 'em?
 (Jay Rock: Give me a minute my nigga let me go find 'em)
 Bring 'em back to me, the 5'6"" rap bully is back for the first time, killing you niggas
 I hope you got nine lives, it's not Nas or Jigga
 But where Jigga left off that is where I pick up
 I got them holding their breath without having no hiccups
 Screaming, ""Fuck the world"" with a capital F
 Real niggas: we the last ones left, MY NIGGA
 I raise the bar for rapping the West
 So have your shit up to par if you rep for the West
 Cause you see homeboy, we ain't getting respect
 So we got to get it back, take it back, to the Jheri curls
 And the Raider caps, my khakis on
 Address the issue in my last three songs
 Man, Game know about you West Coast clones
 And nigga we hate twins
 Put some change on it, see if it makes sense, ya know
 I got to be the new breed top 5 minus 4
 That's number one, cause second is the first loser
 Don't beef with me homie, if you want your future
 Rap ain't promised, you might think it's slamming right
 But look at Onyx, they ain't too tight
 Interscope consults it: look at Suge Knight
 I'm trying to get money like the Oasis
 If you ain't on the same shit like my gold Ds, keep rolling
 I keep rolling, never stop

A Song 4 Buffy,Training Day,,22,3:08,,Mixtape,2,30 Dec 05,26,"Now you got a body
 But what I love most is how you put
 Put your lips on top of me
 You gots to be the baddest bitch I've ever seen in my life
 Wait!
 Your girl look better than you
 You know what that means, I'm done with you
 Bye!
 Imma go hard, so fucking hard till I break the blood vessel out my motherfucking arm
 Whip the wood grain, whip the wood grain till I break the blood vessel out my motherfucking palm
 Break the blood vessel out their motherfucking eye everytime I ride by and they're looking at the charm
 I laugh at em like that, with my seat laid all the, all the way to the back
 And the heat lay right, right, right under that
 Clap, clap, brr, brr, that's the sound of my gat
 That's the sound of a 100 round drum, like a marching band, I'm a stand up guy
 I'mma pump my fist, I'mma wave my hand until I get the attention of the president, pussy
 Presedential suite, laying in, laying in nothing but money
 With a dove skin bitch laying on the side of me
 Reminds me of Buffy, please remind me to fuck her after this freestyle
 100 carat, nigga I'm the golden child
 Full metal jacket, shit, going pow, pow
 Blow your brains out, let it hang out, let the neighbors talk about it, then skip trial
 Wow, I'm amazed by how you niggas talk about you're married to the game, ain't took a vow
 I'll fuck em up, cut em up, shoot em in the foot, or just gun butt em up
 Now, I'm on some other shit, we ain't on the same page
 You ain't sticking to the script
 Let a 100 round clip stick to your lip like Carmex
 Shoot up your whip, fuck your tire, leave your car flat
 Blood or crip, I don't give a fuck bout none of that
 All of y'all can get it, homeboy, it's more than rap
 Training Day, I teach you niggas how to rap
 I rap like I got angels on my back
 God given, I never walk in the booth without the Holy Spirit
 I don't write it
 Off the top like a psychic
 I kick, lyrics like Jet Li
 Which produce money to put your boy on the beach
 Shit, sand in my feet

 I- I hear the beat first, people. I hear the beat first and then I just go wherever the beat is tellin' me... just like all of the, ya know all the other greats say
 What, no pen and no pad?
 Maybe
 I mean but that seems kinda, you know like
 Yeah no pen, no pad then. (No pen no pad.)
 Aight yeah! but I mean aye I just, that's what I see. I mean but is that, does. does that, is that like the breaking point to, to really break you away from other artists that, you know that puts all the artists that don't use pen and a pads a different realm?
 Naw, it just, it just a, a challenge, you know? You know Jay and Big ya know were doin' it way back you know what I'm sayin'? It's just you know- I dunno, it's almost starting to become a cliché now, you know what I'm sayin', I might fuckin back hop on the pen. Naw but uh (laughs) But yeah, but naw. You know.

Dreams,Training Day,,24,4:56,,Mixtape,2,30 Dec 05,26,"Nah, what you get outta, outta not writing your stuff down on paper, you get the more-you know the...expression, the feeling yourself. You know what you want to say; instead of reading a paper that sounds read, it sounds narrated. Unless you wanna do it narrated...
 What if a dream was reality and reality was a dream?
 And as complicated as it seems, if things we imagined actually happened?
 And real life situations was artificial
 They say we only living to die
 Imagine if we're already dead, waiting to live, living in hell
 Trying to cross over to heaven we're confusing ourselves
 Planet Earth's like Ocean's 11, we're plottin' for the getaway
 When my childhood friends get sent away to prison on their first offense
 It's fucked up but listen, we study God but don't know him
 Criticize people that work on Sundays, two jobs just to feed their kids
 Well, momma's scratching lottery tickets knowing that it's just a fairy tale
 Cus' we ain't gonna win
 Every time that she's bubblin' in, it feels like the devil's holding a pen
 (shit)
 Don't mind me I'm just thinking again
 Thinking out loud, thinking the opposite of proud
 'Cause I'm disappointed at my self sometimes
 Self-esteem gets lower than night strippers
 Hard to motivate the right rhymes, inspired by true crimes
 It's not a game, it's nothing to play with
 Turn it off then come back the next day, it's here to stay
 Struggle that is
 I'm so infatuated with knowing something that's waiting after this life
 That means what I'm thinking is right
 Punch, loop the beat for a minute
 Moment of silence for J. Dilla, he on his way home
 Know he see me spillin' my heart, hope for it soon
 Wait a minute K-Dot! you said turn it back on, bring it back
 If dreams was reality
 If it was cool for you to be a casualty
 The only way that you can escape poverty
 Say that I'm weird but obviously you didn't get it when I said it the first time
 You're listening too far if you hear this part
 I suggest you go back and press rewind
 I fast forward to common thoughts of a human
 Deep in my thoughts like Patrick Ewing in the paint
 Look what I brought to my state that they can't bring, the industry need a fix
 Stick heroin needles inside politics, this is crack music
 Opium, inside the veins of them, I don't abuse it
 Capture each moment like film, photo-shooting all my enemies moving
 Direct them to a casket
 Give it to 'em only if they ask for it, if they want...
 If they wanna see reality
 I'm losing you again ain't I?
 Ain't I, the perfect candidate to represent the fifty states?
 Black President, they don't wanna see that
 It's evident...pain is pain
 We only love to hate each other that's striving for great-ness
 I swear to God that we live in a Matrix
 Take that blue pill then we start seeing spaceships
 Kanye, west-coast niggas do it the best
 Bring each other down, crab in a bucket effect
 We learn to live with it I guess
 I mean die with it, since we're already dead
 Trying to cross over to heaven, that's what I said the first time
 Get it? Now little boy I gotta sit you down
 Teach you about the things that we live around
 Materialistic things that we buyin' now means nothing later when the dream kick in
 Fade me out, fade me out, fade me out, fade me out, fade me out, fade me out, fade me out, fade me out...
 What if dreams was reality and money was love
 What would we do for a buzz to maintain our sanity
 Chasing the wind, striving after this vanity
 Traveling, no direction, the aimless casualty
 American dream or Scarface fantasy
 Kilos of coke and the arms of black families
 We use to it, our hearts draped in stone
 A mother's dreams for her baby boy to come back home
 Cus' he out pushin' that chrome, pursuing that cash
 End another niggas dreams when the fo-fifth blast
 Now another mother screams picking out his casket
 Harsh reality, it seems like it's simple mathematics, it's not
 It's trigonometry (trigganometry) divided by some real life
 And he'll do it again just to get a mill' twice
 The streets mowed him, can't make past that
 It's not a dream it's reality, look where it's at [ugh]
 What happened in Manhattan happens all the time
 In the hood, conspiracy to cover up crime
 No nickel and dime, one shot pettiness
 I wrote it in my mind as a letter to the president
 World trade happened on the world stage
 Same stage look at us as some educated apes
 On video stations women gyrating
 Parading around, mind-raping the youth
 Fade me out, fade me out, fade me out, fade me out, fade me out, fade me out, fade me out, fade me out...
 What if a dream was reality and reality was a dream?
 And as complicated as it seems, if things we imagined actually happened?
 And real life situations was artificial
 They say we only living to, die
 Imagine if we're already dead, waiting to live, living in hell
 Trying to cross over to heaven we're confusing ourselves
 Planet Earth's like Ocean's 11, we're plottin' for the getaway
 I'm the man up in this piece! You'll never see the light of da..

The Best Rapper Alive,Training Day,,25,4:01,,Mixtape,2,30 Dec 05,26,"Yea that's right you better walk away
 Go on and walk away cause I'mma burn this motherfucker down
 King Kong ain't got shit on me
 Running them ghetto streets, I ain't cooking up nothing
 But I got the tea kettle on side of me, that metal on side of me
 I dare you to follow me, I'm double daring you to follow me where the drama be
 His momma in debt, so she can't pay the funeral fee
 So wherever them candles at, that's where the funeral be
 Kids don't get sleep, guns keep 'em up real late
 Walk in the school, shells laying on the concrete
 Take 'em to school, show and tell, for that final grade
 She gave him a 'F', I say that young boy deserve a 'A'
 Cause she never slept where he slept, or seen ricochet bullets rip
 Through his cousin's face, ripping his face off
 I aim the fifth straight, concentrate like I'm playing golf
 I'm Tiger Woods with a gun in my car, I keep one in my car
 And keep a bitch with implants, so she keep one in her bra, boom
 Shit, make room for the lil bastard
 The flyest nigga you seen on centennial campus
 The eight ball tucked in my jeans while I'm getting patted down
 They didn't know I had it on me, stupid security
 No one securing you, if I'm gon' touch you
 If I don't like you, the Mossberg pump love you
 I take that back, it probably just wanna go and fuck you
 Go with you, then dump you inside the coneal confortable
 Defending my belt, depending on nobody but myself
 Unless you talking 'bout money, I need yo help
 I need some help, they say that my screws is loose
 Like handlebars on mongoose, this is true
 You tough rappers, I'm talking to you
 He ain't on no used to shit, but you see his face grew
 He say that he fabulous, but really don't have a clue
 That he just a puppy living in this zoo
 Shit, whoo, with that said, you should know I am the truth
 The truth hurts, you should feel pain when I'm done with this verse
 I'm done.... psyche, I ain't finished
 Ever since the first grade, been bad with the run-on sentence
 I never sat the benches in the game of life
 I played the whole forty-eight minutes, Christ
 I rap with precision and lyrics, is grandma nice
 I'm cooking up something, you want you a slice? Then get it
 I'm holding my stomach, I'm shitting, I'm farting
 On any rapper thinking I'm in his vision, is you retarded?
 The CL got my head spinning awkward
 Bought it last month, 'bout to put it up for auction
 I'm not rapping, I'm talking powerful
 And for that dirty money, boy, the Mac'll shower you
 The Mac disintegrate, and then devour you
 The mag'll forget you, regurgitate and sour you
 I world trade you niggas, north and south tower you
 Steroid, my authority overpower you, the industry ain't affording me
 They might as well just give me my money and start ignoring me
 Cause y'all niggas boring me, y'all ain't making no dollars plus no cents
 I swear, y'all niggas foreign to me, foreigners
 I tell you what, go and tell it to the coroner
 Killing 'em whenever my performance come
 When I do it, it won't be nothing right after I'm done
 When I ruin niggas' careers, put you niggas in tears
 Get you pom poms, you better off, cheer for me
 Shit, the new money is here for me",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,https://i1.sndcdn.com/artworks-000410369286-fg3yfa-original.jpg,,,,https://soundcloud.com/kendricklamarcompton/sets/training-day-kendrick-lamar,https://www.datpiff.com/Kendrick-Lamar-K-Dot-Training-Day-mixtape.300692.html,,,,,,241,4.02,0.07,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1,1,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,2,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1,,1,,,,,4,,,2,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Imagine,Training Day,,26,4:03,,Mixtape,2,30 Dec 05,26,"I sit on the studio couch
 Ask myself, ""What the fuck am I thinking about?""
 Thinking 'bout living without the past and the present
 A Dr. Dre record, imagine, I drift off, 600 seconds
 10 minutes exact, letting my mind explore
 K-Dot had turned Curious George
 You know, off the hardship is what I'm curious for
 Like what if Pac had never looked left to holla at broads?
 Before he turned right to get them shots through the door?
 They say Suge did it, but he was in emergency clinic
 So he'd risk his own life to get someone else killed
 But in the process, get injured, it don't make sense
 It's like the Da Vinci Code, trying to solve the crime of these rap souls
 What if B.I.G. never did it big?
 Never went to L.A., would it make a difference in them bullet-holes?
 Would it make my flow more persistent?
 Would it raise up the bar of competition? Who knows
 Who told Nastradamus baby momma was fucking with HOV?
 Would the battle be less interesting if it wasn't personal?
 If Jay wasn't intimate, there'd probably be less people listening
 People thinking it's a publicity stunt
 What if he partnered with Jay and still didn't blow?
 Hip-hop would really be fucked
 Something like Milli Vanilli
 Nothing different, quite similar
 Filling up my mind capacity
 Thinking about Martin Luther, on the balcony
 What if the shooter-
 Better yet, what if Malcolm on the side?
 Killed two birds with one stone, both would've died
 Now let's rewind
 Before we go, can you imagine?
 Picture years with your mom
 Can you imagine?
 Hang her picture in the sky
 Can you imagine?
 Call emergency, I've been dreamin' all my life
 Imagine if Tookie was a Blood? Look, no disrespect
 But would there be more Bloods than Crips sets?
 Dominating the population of
 L.A., Orange County, the Valley, and back up to the bay?
 Matter fact, imagine if we didn't really start this gangster shit
 Y'all wouldn't have nothin' to spit
 No drive-bys, no flags stickin' out pockets
 No N.W.A. dudes, just rappin' like Cre Cru
 Imagine if Mike Concepcion walked on his own two
 Feet no paralyzed, would he be alive?
 Or would he been lost his life to the streets?
 No match, no cars in that driveway
 What if Freeway Rick never was a kingpin?
 On this L.A. strip, would these rap niggas use his name?
 Nah, what if rap niggas never had rap?
 Would they try to fall back on this drug game?
 These rappers ass backwards
 Now these rappers getting caught with the cocaine
 But to smoke, not to slang
 Imagine that people not knowing these rap niggas insane
 Just think about it
 Before we go, can you imagine?
 Picture years with your mom
 Can you imagine?
 Hang her picture in the sky
 Can you imagine?
 Call emergency, I've been dreamin' all my life
 Imagine life without death, would you even feel alive?
 Your people that passed, what if they never died?
 Imagine seeing your mom cry, tears of happiness
 Knowing her son safe, and she ain't lose him to this madness
 The street living, what if the crack epidemic
 Never reached the projects and destroyed our buildings?
 Turned most of us to killers, innocent victims
 Imagine if heroin didn't affect our system
 They say drug money funding the labels today
 What about the drug money that's funding the C.I.A.?
 Imagine if they really tried to fix these streets
 Would they start in the hood, or executive suites?
 Where the real criminals meet, and principals beef with me
 You could possibly live without heat
 Imagine if Al Gore had won that election
 Would the Twin Tower buildings still stand erected?
 Imagine the penal system without witness protection
 Would there be these many cowards on the stand telling?
 I don't know, I'm just speaking my mind
 Lost in my own soul, just press rewind and imagine

The Show,No Sleep Til NYC,,2,3:37,,Mixtape,3,24 Dec 07,20,"Let's start our program ladies and gentlemen
 Let's go
 NYC baby, haha we here now haha
 Let's get it in
 Watch her getting jumping like third grade barrettes
 Let the beretta blow you die slow while I smoke on chron-ic
 Try to throw salt homie like dry sweat gun powder flow through triceps
 I'm more advanced got a corvette flow, I spit like Murcielago
 Through precipitation I give rappers a sun tan
 Rapping like a promotional van when I pull the drum out
 Clap more than a Beatle fan, never heard a sound like this
 I'm number one, you're forever number two like Siamese
 This is New York rap on gold Ds
 Jay Rock proceed
 Get it in like IVs
 My flow is not on radar, the K-9 D
 Play y'all like chess, you can't check us, come correct
 Or face a lyrical bomb threat
 I bomb first like Makaveli in '96
 The nine mili have you on your death bed sick
 See really I'm a project baby
 Niggas are going Barney raised me
 Crooked cops
 Stop sign got a bullet whole, don't stop
 Speed through it like a drag race, or get buried under the state
 K-Dot
 Expose niggas for who they are
 Under their white T might be halter tops
 Rap fags, the black mag come with a complimentary black mask
 Black Jason, red beam on the Glock
 Money talks, I'm trying to have a life long conversation
 Live like a silver spoon caucasian with a chain of hotel rooms across the nation
 No home training, break 1,000,000 dollar vases
 Here we go yo, here we go yo
 I got the special kind of flow they call it hip-hop antidote
 Murder MCs, if you're a rapper please check your pulse
 (Hurry Up) too late
 (Flat line) John Doe
 Dead than a motherfucker, Damn I'm a motherfucker
 (BLUCKA BL-BLUCKA BLUCKA BL-BLUCKA)
 Let his Momma suffer
 I ball like the West Coast at Harlem Rucker
 But at venice beach, jump shots I'm finna see
 Fuck a drop top, that's how they killed Kennedy
 I'm in a bronco, OJ in the city streets
 With my AC on (With your AC on?)
 Shit don't try to play me homes
 Jump stupid, then ask to get filet mignon
 I'ma break him in half (and I'ma dumbthe bones)
 Spill out (Then light the blunt)
 With the butt of the comb
 I got a lock like riper
 25-to-lifers, walk in the yard and never fold in a riot
 You know who we are, Top Dawg generals
 I thank God for rap, my career was being a criminal
 Bliss
 New level Hip Hop
 Where my shovel? Let me convince Nas
 Dig a couple graves tell 'em that the new rap zombie is alive to invade
 On the masses south central true best I
 40 Glock stashes, buck 50 score left eye
 Going back to Cali in a New York state of mind
 I can't wait
 You know, nigga ain't never hopped on no, no subway train you know
 Might catch the blue line or something
 Metro Bus
 125 Street down Rosecrans, 53 down central
 Hahahaha, It's all new to us you know
 Get out the hood for once
 Statue of Liberty, I wanna see the fire on that motherfucker
 The fire really burn in that motherfucker?
 Heh, you see a nigga don't a nigga don't ever know and shit
 I ain't never seen snow nigga
 Southern California
 Crenshaw, gangbanging can't slang it

I Ain't No Joke,No Sleep Til NYC,,3,2:53,,Mixtape,3,24 Dec 07,20,"I ain't no joke I used to let the mic smoke
 Now I'm like Mike Jordan with the flow
 Identify with a scientific scope
 Scope over the rifle
 Fragments and potholes
 Got rappers selling surveillance behind black tint in the parking lot at Roscoes
 Making the change lift straight jack move
 Pack 2 some mechanic
 Pull it out you panic, flow nuts like cashews
 Shift to Cancun, even though I’m Compton
 Like Raider caps and Corduroy house shoes
 I be the illest witness the lyrical drug dealin’
 When I distribute the word these rappers get hard feelings
 No remorse sucka MCs throw fits cause I carry the torch without Olympics
 Kill all friendships my enemies
 Go against the God MC penalty crucifixion
 So nice wish you had 3 ear drums to listen
 Damn right I be the don Corleone of rap songs whether on the east cost or back home
 We clap chrome like magnetic monkey wrenches
 Used to hop fences
 Now we hop on top of bad bitches pass em to the homies like basketball assists
 West Coast Vengeance, East Coast Revenue something new like
 Pac in Versace lenses Big in the Khaki Suit
 Best of both worlds when I step in the booth
 Suicidal thugs from them him her and you
 I kick away the chair you hang from the noose
 Shoutout to Sidegun and Papoose, Kunta Kinte and
 Bringing it back to the roots, you understand
 Yeah yeah yeah from Cali to N.Y.
 You already know lets get it in
 (I ain’t no joke)
 Like Mike Tyson in his prime, knocking out rappers with every line
 Won't attest how I come back with a forty-five
 Like MJ, sucker MCs expire
 LA Nigga not to be fucked with, Thug Quick
 Guns tucked nigga we buck shit
 We do pop take off your rooftop
 On the rooftop with choppas infrared dot ya
 One shot no doctors, just yellow tape and white sheets
 Buck chrome tell em why
 Living like felipe though you lay on our paper
 Yo' life we repo play for keeps, no need for peace talk
 Catch contact whenever the weed spark
 Yeah its chronic in whatever we smoke
 Got signed but I’m still in the hood like a brick of blow
 Hit the club made my pick'n’roll this should give em dough
 Jay Rock used to be in them drug spots
 Now I rap for the dough all for the moolah, hoo-ha
 Sucker MCs no threat, i could run laps around each one no sweat
 They’d all be scared of me, no one ahead of me
 Nailed to the throne, I’m a project celebrity
 These niggas ain’t all that they said they’d be
 Nothing but images raping the youth stealing their benjamins
 Under the dirt is where we sending them
 New coupe speed off color be cinnamon
 Nike Cortezess, and Pendletons
 LA style hop out slide doors on a minivan
 Its like that spray the whole block if we miss one spot, what we gotta do
 Come right back
 I play the passenger
 Dumb shot then pour gas on ya
 Acting like Nelson as I laugh at ya
 The young boy Casper ya
 Ya soul rise out the casket bruh

Enjoy Life,No Sleep Til NYC,,4,3:15,,Mixtape,3,24 Dec 07,20,"I'm the coolest nigga you know
 Migrated from the North Pole when I was fo'
 Infatuated with cartoons and G.I. Joes
 'Til something more greater took a toll: life
 Not really, more like white Air Nikes
 Evidently, I had a fondness for material things
 Ten years old trynna get a 10k ring
 I forgot it was for me when the phone ringed
 Elementary girls callin' the house
 Desiree and Cheryl mama end hustled what we talkin' about
 I'm talkin' about the good old days when we walked without knowing that could be our last time walking out
 Now we can't walk witout protection
 Bein' on the defensive, life ills
 This life will put you in a crazy world
 Just by knowing crime will never cure
 So I'm strapped like Girbaud jeans
 I'd rather see the pen like I was bowling
 Rather than death, walkin' on heavy steps
 It's a great place, but I ain't ready for Heaven yet
 So I told God put me at the back of the line
 Matter fact yesterday, swear to God I ain't lyin'
 Movin' at a turtle pace, cause the fast lane got a day one uncle with one in the brain
 Got one in the chamber
 Sixteen in the clip, my eyes fluttered with anger
 Hip-hop trynna save my life
 Give credit whenever it's due, the money touchin' the roof
 Breakin' the ceiling, with that being I'm breakin' the loot
 With my loved ones, life way too short, son
 Shoul is, gotta wake up
 Like a bakery, I'm trynna get the cake up
 Never know when the day come, so we live carefree
 Party like it's 1999, cherry cherry breath that I breath
 Materialistic things, it won't mean shit when you leave
 I ain't lyin', a nigga miss the good old days
 Sippin Kool-Aid, Mama let the OJs play
 Nowadays, it seems like the end is near
 Cause babies killin' babies like Brenda did
 Use ya head, mess around lose ya wig
 Age fifteen, shit, a nigga witnessed it
 Walking home from school, just me and my team
 Shots fired, I guess it wasn't meant for me
 So I thank the man in the skies above for his blessings until a nigga rise above
 I'm fly as a dog, more dope than a drug
 On the microphone, lemme kick the verse for y'all
 Hip-hop'll never die as long as we alive
 Top Dawg E-N-T, haters don't even try
 You don't wanna pay the price of a lyrical ass-whoopin', we'll let it fly
 Watch your career go up in flames, let it fry
 Watch it die, no get back, just sit back, enjoy the ride
 Live like it's no tomorrow, enjoy life
 I'm still reflectin' on the death of
 Mission of the better
 Only one that's necessary for Sarah
 See, ya'll can say whatever, but still it come together
 I used to rip it down and let you sew it back together
 Hip-hop forever, fuck 'em and whoever fed up
 And I wish a hex on whoever met 'em
 I'm obsessed with objection
 And I'd probably blame Common for my resurrection
 I used to love her too
 So when I'm in the booth, we do what lovers do
 But I ain't stingy, let my niggas get a piece of her too
 Another piece and I'm through
 Probably trynna peace up with you
 Niggas got some believin' to do
 It starts now",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,https://i1.sndcdn.com/artworks-000410383362-2uvpsv-original.jpg,,,,https://soundcloud.com/kendricklamarcompton/sets/no-sleep-til-nyc-kendrick,https://www.datpiff.com/Kendrick-Lamar-Jay-Rock-No-Sleep-Til-NYC-mixtape.202088.html,,,,,,195,3.25,0.05,,Yes,1,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,2,,,,,,,,,,,,1,,,,,,,,,,,,X,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,2,2,,,,,,1,,3,,,,,1,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
C.R.E.A.M.,No Sleep Til NYC,,5,3:43,,Mixtape,3,24 Dec 07,20,"It's all about this money, kid
It's all about this money, C.R.E.A.M.
Y'na'mean?
I gotta get it, son
I gotta get it, my pocket's hurt again
(Cash rules everything around me
C.R.E.A.M., get the money)
Starvin' out here, yo
(Dolla dolla bill, y'all)
I grew up on the crime side
The LA Times-side
Wrong turn might mean homicide
Used to move with the Rupers
Talk shit, we'll shoot ya
At your dice game, rob ya for your moolah
It's like that
Cash rules everything
Fiends strung out,
So they try to sell you anything
Listen son
Never sell crack for fun
I was hungry
A nigga sold crack for funds
Had to get my weight up
Enemies, sprayed up
Got rid of the whole brick, and then we re-up
Sittin' in a money spot
Cookin' up the product
You tried to infiltrate the shop
You got shot up
Lil kids in the projects,
They wanna be us
No father figures,
Nothin' that you could teach us
Ghetto streets-raised
Is blowin' weed and Black & Milds
Gangbangin'
Cane-slangin' for deaths and miles
Livin' wild
Young, black, and don't give a fuck
Just a young hustler,
Specializing in getting bucks
Nigga, some garden is where we get our hustle at
Ain't shit to say even one time
We bussin' that
There's no discrimination
You will get assassinated for the paper
Shoot first and ask questions later
See ya later, alligator
As your casket drop
Then we back to the block
And we steady sayin'
(Cash rules everything around me)
Yo, straight up son
(C.R.E.A.M., get the money)
That's what it's about
(Dolla dolla bill, y'all)
It's all about this cream, y'all
(Cash rules everything around me)
Cash rules everything around me
(C.R.E.A.M., get the money)
Y'na'mean?
(Dolla dolla bill, y'all)
Snotty-nosed kid with dreams of getting C.R.E.A.M.
Like cake batter
By any means, son
We make your face splatter
Word life
I never understood the broke type
Thinkin' back then when I hustled my first stolen bike
I used to gamble with silver dollars
Now I gamble with Benjamin Franklins, Dom Pérignon, and lobster
Money-making for real, kid
I'm tryin' stay fresh like Will did
Back in the '90s
Killer bees behind me
Swarming anything that enter the perimeter
Of this money-making machine
When winter come,
It goes down
We balls out
And you?
You just out of bounds
Without a doubt
We move in unison
You move like a Honda with the brakes gone out
Out of control
You just might
Powder your nose
If you step on the mic after me
Drug residue
Every time I leave the booth
You fall far behind
A time machine can't save you
Me?
I'm ahead of the pack
Like a high-speed pursuit
We kick flows
Then rekick 'em like kung fu
I'm Bruce Lee
Whether Nikes or Timbos
Beefcake the poppy, see
We ain't scared to shoot
Carry three pieces on me
Like a Steve Harvey suit
I'm on my Method Man shit
The 3 west coast Wu Tang members now exist
For the C.R.E.A.M. I beam to retrieve it
Believe it
I ain't only sowin', I reapin'
Benefits out the asshole
That so?
Damn straight
Fabricated transaction by a handshake
I win by a landslide
Scopin' your landscape
Kick in the damn door
Give me your damn safe
They all say crime don't pay
But if it'll get me more than what this 9-to-5 gon' pay
Rock, let me borrow the K
Hit my adversaries
I'd rather it be a bullet than my vocabulary
Currently stash currency in the shoebox
For emergency purposes only
So I'm never worthless
Bubblin' like a bottom of my way
Way, stacks so fat
Benjamins growin' a double chin
Raised the quota for quotas
Hunnid dollar knot holders
Livin' that dream
Gettin' that cream
It take 36 Chambers
That's 18 double-barrel shotties aimed at everybody in the way
No gettin' between this
Just a genius
Inspect your deck
No money involved?
Expect eject
Yo, it's only for Cuban links
And your necklace is anorexic
Get your weight up
I'm runnin' to the bank like I'm off a bounce pass
Then I layup
I live every day up
Top notch
In other words
Stay up",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,https://i1.sndcdn.com/artworks-000410383362-2uvpsv-original.jpg,,,,https://soundcloud.com/kendricklamarcompton/sets/no-sleep-til-nyc-kendrick,,,,,,,223,3.72,0.06,,Yes,3,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1,,,,,,,7,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The Real Hip Hop,No Sleep Til NYC,,6,1:22,,Mixtape,3,24 Dec 07,20,"Did you meet Rock from Cali to Italy?
 It'd be like something you've never seen, literally
 Soul brother, this rap shit is like a cult
 But I don't give a shit, I'll wear it like a coat
 You know, I'm so hip hop I love it to death
 From a DJ Scratch to graffiti on yo set
 B boys that could spin on they head, you know the best
 I had the karaoke machine, recording cassettes
 Fill up my cup like support for breasts
 I reflect back like when niggas used to flow for respect
 But its all marketing now, if you ain't got a gimmick
 Know what’s his name, or you ain’t got an image
 Probably won't last a minute
 Then you wonder why these old-heads, wonder whats happening with it
 Back in the day, when a album came out, yo you had to get it
 Prior to iTunes my room full of LPs
 Like a ma and pa shop
 All thanks to my mom's pawn shop
 Boppin' on it since birth
 And I'm all in on hot
 More cuts than a club sandwich
 Here to cause all you industry thugs damage
 Live from the 310, and we wan't more
 Like eeeny miney, serve anybody
 Hand me they keys, I'm only trying to unlock my dreams but
 Ha ye Ab-Soul

Dead Presidents III,No Sleep Til NYC,,7,3:36,,Mixtape,3,24 Dec 07,20,"I defy odds even if I divide y'all
 At least 10 percent of my rhythm is arithmetic
 Killer with the wit, drench em in the spit
 Infrared hot, chillin' with your bitch, you're dead right
 You're dead wrong without your dead presidents
 I'm an old head but Ab stack bread present tense
 What part about making money represents you?
 You're on the broke side, I rock your boat ride, don't cry
 Get your paper up like hands at my shows
 I send this verse through MoneyGram
 A hundred grand for my flow
 Aside from the fast cars and the chains that glow
 There's gotta be a better way to go
 Like them backstreets, ducking them sobriety tests
 Blunt in the ashtray, Colt 45 on your breath
 Fuck what Ab say, I told Carlito it's that way
 Blow dinero, torpedo through your national bank and
 Pay attention, niggas
 Get money, being broke is a joke, homie it ain't funny
 Get money, being broke is a joke, homie it ain't funny
 Get, get money my niggas
 Get money, being broke is a joke, homie it ain't funny
 Get, get money my bitches
 Get money, being broke is a joke, homie it ain't funny
 You probably thinking I'm aggravated when I say I foresee the future
 Minus the white boy on Final Destination
 They say it's one Nation under God
 But my reality, one person under a gun
 And the funny thing
 My paper chasing just begun
 Still premature and being the black entrepeneur
 In this world where we lust for more money, cash and whores
 Got me defining life without my high school thesaurus
 Blink twice when you see my Porsche headlights
 My car is better than yours
 I rub it in, like over-the-counter ointment
 You're in desperation thinking that you can coexist
 With the immortal vocalist, Ford dealerships ain't this focussed
 Even when barefooted, the funky rhythm I still kick
 Dead presidents is the medicine for my evil heart
 More Franks than a ballpark, porcupine sharp
 When I dress, when I talk, a dollar bill eject
 My conversations about money, what you expect?
 Get money, being broke is a joke, homie it ain't funny
 Get money, being broke is a joke, homie it ain't funny
 Get, get money my niggas
 Get money, being broke is a joke, homie it ain't funny
 Get, get money my bitches
 Get money, being broke is a joke, homie it ain't funny
 Finna diminish any nigga tryna get involved
 The fuck they be thinking? Nothing at all
 They go against, but still can't float against
 No options, flows like a cheese pizza, no topping
 Big rig through both lanes, you play possum
 You can't see me, flow cleaner than the water made by Fiji
 Money clip like feed me, flyer than an airman straight from Tuskegee
 Shoot you out the air man, bring your high down
 The next morning your hungover from the sober sound
 Or the four pound, Soviet Unions in your town
 What your homies doin?
 Theres some more bullets to go around, now
 We can all get paper like Xerox
 Or we can just reset Tetris and clear blocks
 Or better yet sum us out the money and buy stock
 Or call Will to the car dealer and buy the lots
 Getting paid period, every hour on the dot
 Get money, being broke is a joke, homie it ain't funny
 Get money, being broke is a joke, homie it ain't funny
 Get, get money my niggas
 Get money, being broke is a joke, homie it ain't funny
 Get, get money my bitches

It Ain't Hard 2 Tell,No Sleep Til NYC,,8,2:48,,Mixtape,3,24 Dec 07,20,"It ain't hard to tell that I live in hell
 Sin City watch city gotta get your mail
 How I sleep when I die that's real
 There's only two ways out: living under the dirt or life in the cell
 I'm still on the block tryna make me a sell
 You can't make too much, some niggas might tell
 That's how it is homie, when you up in your shit
 Get locked up, your friends might hook on your bitch
 Its fuck a ho, that's why I'm all about my chips
 To live and die broke, it's some embarrassing shit
 That's why I'm hooking a block, fuck hooking a bitch
 When the wars on, I'm bustin' em clips
 Shit I'm just trying to stack paper
 Blowing big weed, I'm high like a skyscraper
 L.A nigga in a New York state of mind
 When I rhyme verses like Cool J back in '85, I'm hot lava
 Gold Ds on my low rider 4'5 so original like a ol' timer
 2 pistols, one llama
 In the back of the trunk like who want drama? nobody
 Sitting back I got this, a project prophet
 I could predict when my goons ready to pop shit
 When the funds is low
 We're on the hunt for tons of blow
 Summer time, in Cali homie all we do is snow
 Counting dollars, til our hands get callused
 Won't stop hustling til the judge bang the gaval
 Prayin' for the better days
 Sit in the club celebrate
 Pop bottles, with top models back on the interstate
 Traffic and chickens homie we trying to get it
 Then we back in the kitchen whipping like a chemist
 Hunger pangs got me acting a fool in that dinner time
 Life is like a racing track trying to get to the finish line
 Slaughter pigs like farmer John
 My style got its own ambience
 You feel my presence? live life like everyday class in session
 Learn something after 187 we burn some
 For real kid, our uncle doing a 13 year bid
 I pray to god he don't come out how he went in
 Gets ill, these streets got me packing a 9 mill
 My mind stay black, either kill or be killed
 It's real in the battlefield son
 Last week shawty do wop he at the ooh wop he said he ready to kill some
 I said shawty chill, you ain't ready for that type of drama
 Plus karma for real
 He shook his head, horizontal
 He said he was out on consignment some dudes on the block tried to rob em
 Try? what you mean?
 He said they tried until I reached in to the pocket of my jeans
 I killed 2, but one got away which is bad news, because the hood didn't even cover my whole face
 And I know he be back, but before he do that
 I bring it to him first on the porch where he live at
 Damn shawty I can't knock you, its survival of the fittest
 With that said, do what you got to
 I shook his hand, then I walked away, then reality took a toll on me
 Shoulda never gave him that .38
 Looking at the ceiling in my bedroom
 Then the phone rang, hey K-Dot turn on the news
 They didn't even say his name
 But I knew it was him when it said another 7th grader was slayed

 Connecting with the masses a smooth operator

 Exterminatin’ sucker MCs

 Kami-kaze, snap shots at you like papparazzi
 Definition, Junior Mafia
 Kick in the door, wavin' the four-four
 All you heard was ""Dot, don't hit me no more""
 Kick in the door, wavin' the four-four
 All you heard was ""Punch, don't hit me no more""
 It's Punch people, on a quest for the root of evil
 Tread softly, death row is where the Ruger leave you
 I'm no shooter, but you know my people
 Blood pressure get to boilin', you know black people
 They got them .44s, MACs, them Eagles
 Pack them in the back of a Reagle, and come clap your people
 Ride the track like a Mack truck on diesel, mattafact
 I don't rap, i just do it for my people
 It's so easy, treat the flow like a freethrow
 Tryna' take me out my zone, watch me let three go
 I'm 36, old, speak with eses, kilos
 Icicle flow, yeah, I'm so below zero
 Kick in the door if you try and play the hero
 20 like the heat, you casino
 Kick in the door, wavin' the four-four
 All you heard was ""Dot, don't hit me no more""
 Kick in the door, wavin' the four-four
 All you heard was ""Punch, don't hit me no more""
 I don't worry bout' none of you rappers
 Most of y'all talking practice, actors like Denzel
 Until you trapped in a lion den with stake
 Under your chin, oh well, shouldn't play with Big Poppa
 357 over my boxers
 Magnum, tell the doctor I shot ya, ugh
 Toe tag 'em, crack with purple tops, we bag 'em
 House licks, we ski mask 'em, baby baby
 Let me get it, let me sink my teeth in it
 Put you niggas in a cobra clutch,with no submission
 It's to the death, to the endin'

 Something like Prince Akeem 2 in the semi
 Super soak ya, anti-social, for the mail I'll go postal
 Postpone your post put it on pause with no controller at all
 Just a nickel plated fo-fo, pockets got a melody, carryin' notes
 Without bad breath, still carry the scope
 I infrared whoever infiltrate, or disrespect, my money make it intellect, like a safety you intercept, a chain of bullets
 They vics when they rubbing your chest, pincher
 I treat all beef tender, no shook ones around here son
 You like Michael Jay Fox when them bad boys come
 Not Will Smith or Martin Lawrence, I'm talkin' 'bout boys that'll surely inspire your life insurance, life is short
 Your reality is at the height of a dwarf
 Say goodbye to the bitches and the champagne corks
 Say hello to the ditches where your homies is tossed, in it
 Porche blocks be black tinted, everything stocked
 Catch me running over civilians, middle finger up when i'm removing the ceiling, dissect the whole block when i'm removing your building, this goes out to every man, woman and children
 I don't discriminate, shook ones get earthquaked
 Rappers are scared to death, they're scared to look
 Cause ain't no such thing as halfway crooks
 Niggas shook from the door like ""Who is 'dem boys?""
 Anything happen in front of it they're responsible for it
 Niggas play hardcore like they really want a war
 Find themselves ductaped in the Ford Explorer
 Like ""This ain't even car ford, how I end up in this?""
 Walkin' on the ocean's floor at the bottom of the abyss
 I'm guttin' you guppies up, take a nap with the fish
 We don't wanna talk about it, we know where you live
 Mattafact, we got pictures of your kids
 Tryna' talk himself out of it, but he don't wanna hear
 What a mess, look at what you niggas did
 Dig a hole, bury yourself, by a jump off the bridge
 This no subliminal, you know who we is
 Tried to do the snake thing, but we got to his ribs
 Not the rib that protect his organs, but rib meaning his woman that be spending his fortune
 Huh, hop out the frying pan scorching, right into the fire
 Hitman for hire, Punch
 When I be in the block, rappers, they get shook up
 Cause what i'm holdin' that get your soul took up
 Blukah! Sound of the chrome plated woopa
 House flyin' straight to your medula, suit up
 When it's time for war, lace your boots up
 My advice ; get your head bulletproofed up
 No mercy, when the tool bust, smooch ya
 Leave your ass asking for your future, who ya?
 I don't know ya', gotta show ya, folding dough like yoga
 Don't approach us, nurse bag get smoked fast like a penitentiary box
 Of cigarettes, (yeah) we still got that work posted on the ave

 But we burn white flags, so its probably no use
 They tell me we hot, I’m looking like who?
 Probably in heaven is the only time you couldn’t show me some proof
 Until then keep stepping’ while I act a animal in the booth
 You looking at the one man sitting zoo, pity the fool thats denying the truth

TopDawg Ent,No Sleep Til NYC,,14,3:08,,Mixtape,3,24 Dec 07,20,"Tonight's the night I jump on my shh... uh huh?
 Lyrical mayhem, rappers get laid down when I kick
 K rounds, a transformer how I break down
 Nouns and verbs, you just stumble over your words
 So in love with my shit they save it in pampers
 The only pull ups be the drive by when I pull up then pull out
 Whatever you did shout I put up
 Then take the residuals after leaving your body in critical
 Fuck 'em all though, more drive than a car show
 Four five in the console, call me Soul Eastwood
 Lyrical gun slanging’ and a corral full of wild niggas
 PC shut down niggas, it's P.E. I run around niggas
 You shawn pope you just sound bigger
 You bad boys bite the brick like snitches bite bullets
 No diss to Diddy, that's just how I like to put it
 Living’ life crooked like a neck muscle after you pull it
 187, look at the footage
 Like O-Dawg, and oh you Oh Dog, you either pay up
 Or have your daughter makin’ that ransom phone call
 Player, I don’t tolerate niggas who fabricate stories
 Who says you did what (what?)
 I’m sounding like Noreaga for the paper
 One leg to erase ya, kinda ironic
 Calling the shots like Chick Hearn in intern
 Your chick hair fall in my crotch, follow me pop
 Spit champagne, they should bottle me up
 We on the edge like when my barber be lining me up
 Never pledge allegiance, my mom must've done bred a demon
 My pop must've done shot bullets instead a semen
 I led a legion of doom cramped up in the womb
 And started teething the day I heard a beat, let's eat
 Yeah, Top Dawg E-N-T
 And it's 187 on a muthafuckin' beat
 Yeah, Top Dawg E-N-T
 And it's 187 on a muthafuckin' beat
 Yeah, Top Dawg E-N-T
 And it's 187 on a muthafuckin' beat
 Yeah, Jay Rock, Watts ambassador
 Big truck, paint color Almond Joy
 Black choppers seem like the commodores
 Get money, fuck bitches, do it like a chore
 That's the routine, 24 hours
 More money, more power, fuck problems
 Pop my collar, hit clubs and pop bottles
 For the dollars I’m Master P, 'bout It, 'bout It
 Take a look at my wrist
 Now look at my
 It feels like I have a fuckin’ jukebox on
 You niggas ain’t hot, you niggas lukewarm
 And I had swag ever since I was born
 And every car I drive, yes it must be foreign
 So when I ride by your bitch yelling popcorn
 I get up under your skin, yes I’m a fuckin' thorn
 And they have a stash spot and you just been warned, bitch
 Game said it first, I’m the next out the west
 Want a test? Knock your spirit up out your flesh
 Who’s the best rapper, I’m his favorite rapper
 Too Fresh like a nigga still in the wrapper
 I’m the shit like a nigga still in a pamper
 Hit a booth, kill a track then we light candles
 187 everytime I spit a scripture
 Jay Rock, Watt City, I’m the perfect picture
 You ain’t gotta worry about who’s hotter
 I been poppin’ collars
 Been making it rain in the club, I been about my dollars
 I can’t seen colors, I’m colorblind
 So when you hit me up, all you gon' see is fuckin' dollar signs
 Got my motivation, my nigga stay on the grind
 Even if it's back on the block pushing nickels and dimes
 Addicted to crime, I fuck with known felons

Death Around the Corner,No Sleep Til NYC,,15,3:18,,Mixtape,3,24 Dec 07,20,"I rather die on my mother fucking feet 'fore a nigga live on his knees
 Twin Glocks in my palm back against the wall I'm ready for war
 My enemies die slow when I ride screaming THUG LIFE pistol in the sky
 Remember me as a real nigga when I go
 The Hennessy got me riding dirty with my crew, nigga M-O-B
 Pussy ass niggas better duck they tails
 Niggas can hide when my squad bail nigga we ballin
 Alizé and weed keept on callin' gotta get some more
 Intoxicated got almost had me falling lemme hit the floor
 World Wide MOB figures I bet you all of my niggas ready to die nigga
 Can you feel me? World Wide MOB Figure
 Don't even wear yo strap if you ain't ready to die nigga
 My attitude like fuck it middle finger towards the public
 Bringing buckets to all my adversaries and I love it
 My momma stress every night telling me to slow down
 I said ""Momma I'm in too deep ain't no turning back now""
 Cause the niggas from the other side they want me dead
 Catch me slipping roll up on me put a hole in my head
 And the chronic just to got me even more paranoid
 Looking out the window if they coming I'm ready for 'em
 Just remember 2Pacalypse never ran from 'em
 Ran to 'em eyes open with both guns dump'n
 And till then tell them mother fuckers to strap up
 Guns blazing when they act up
 I see death around the corner
 I see death around the corner
 I see death around the corner
 I see death around the corner
 I see death around the corner
 So I move way different than I used to
 Eyes in back of my head everything bulletproof
 Walking out the house cautious
 Circle round the block twice before my car park it
 My allies despise my success so they got me watching my every step
 No exaggeration I know I can feel the reapers breath
 Hovering over me like a helicopter or a 747 on autopilot
 All of my problems dissolve once I take control of my own destiny
 Hop on my murder chart overcome the odds
 This goes out to all my dogs
 Just holler if you hear me like a charger made by dodge made by dodge
 Just ask Pac what it's like to be ready every night
 AK-47 by the window aiming at car lights
 For Makaveli the Mac is ready to explode
 On any mother fucker who curse his soul
 Death around the corner
 I saw him near last week
 In my Oldsmobile some niggas try to blast me
 So I cocked back the 4-5 no lie
 Let my trigger finger fly like Nigga Nigga die
 Close call player haters wanna see me fall
 I shows no mercy you better be ready for war
 Fuck the law should I ride on my own two
 No crew just see what this Mac-11 gon do
 Plenty bodies gon be dropping soon as I come through
 Hop out let it rip head slugs go threw
 BOW-BOW-BOW-BOW sound of my melody
 Murder murder kill kill what them voices be telling me
 Ever since a baby a nigga was living crazy
 Age 13 playing with heaters ready for beef like
 You want it you can get it anyway that you want it
 Hit yah block, parents get smoked fast like marijuana
 I trust no one everyday I'm watching my back
 It's a well known fact that I see death around the corner",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,https://i1.sndcdn.com/artworks-000410383362-2uvpsv-original.jpg,,,,https://soundcloud.com/kendricklamarcompton/sets/no-sleep-til-nyc-kendrick,https://www.datpiff.com/Kendrick-Lamar-Jay-Rock-No-Sleep-Til-NYC-mixtape.202088.html,,,,,,198,3.3,0.06,,Yes,7,,,,,,,2,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,4,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,2,,1,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

 Sip that light spliff who’s that snatch ya bitch
 Nothing but a G party like Pac in '96
 But it's '07 no half steppin’
 Get outta line no mercy nigga we blast weapons
 California economics got me hooked on it like phonics
 When the beat drop I drop a bomb like atomic
 Got my heat cocked like some type of bird
 Big pimpin’ weapon under the fur
 Limping’ like a prosthetic leg
 But still play the back like bike pegs
 La fitted cap pulling your wig back
 With Glocks in it G roc black tinted

 You don’t wanna test, give you lames the business
 Watts, California pay hell a visit, where a wrong turn can be your last visit
 Pitbulls on
 5 in the morning I’m up cooking it up
 Studio filled with coffee cups
 I don’t sleep I just lay down and wink
 I work like slavery was just last week
 Somebody told me that every label
 Got this button that beep and when I rap it go off
 And thats when they know to push their album back
 I don’t allow cats around the big dogs
 You can’t see me, the force between us is thick fog
 I never hang up when the money calls unless it be a emergency that my family involved
 Don’t get your life involved, we’ll shoot without playing basketball, get your ass mopped
 Like Lysol, you light MC, I’m heavy on the track
 If you see my flow you would say its obese

 While you save em like coupons we throw away
 Extra large Magnum wrappers
 (We them nasty rappers)
 We them Magnum blasters
 (Say hello to the pastor)
 Coughin' up a loogie when I'm walking past your casket
 See I don't give a shit about my enemies
 Feel the same way about a bitch
 Speaking of a bitch these hoes is no joke
 Tell a story any chance they get
 Where my money at? She talking bout she broke
 Now I can dig in her left pocket
 Dig in her right pocket, dig in her back pocket
 Pull money out of all three and still swear up and down that she don't got it
 Bitch, you must think I'm the fool
 You better hop up on the track and put that pussy to use

 I seen this bitch right she fine than a motherfucker I ain’t gone lie straight up
 I take her home though, fucked and got off, pitbull type
 Now do I love them hoes, hell no
 Take her to the swap meet before Melrose
 Benihana, more like like Top Ramen noodles
 Champagne no sweet Kool-Aid made by Sherane
 Send her back to her boyfriend with cum stains
 I redesign bitches wardrobe
 All I do is make up something then sit it between her earlobes
 She thinking no one ever invented clothes
 Used to hide the camera in the closet
 Now I’m like I’m doing you a favor to fuck you bitch pose
 They don’t even want to go to award shows
 They just wanna award me with hoes
 Put em on a track like vocals
 Leave em for a day and they want their master back like the first album by Jay
 I dash with the dividends no shit if Big Pimpin is a sin then I rather not repent (preach)
 Girl on the phone
 You know I need my master back like Jay Z first album

Best Rapper Under 25,C4,,2,3:15,,Mixtape,4,30 Jan 09,18,"Weezy wassup with it bruddah?
 Tell Maestro I need to fuck over his beat real quick
 Hear me?
 I'm the best rapper under 25, 24 inches on my ride
 Ball like 23 and I shot my first .22 when I was nine
 I'm the best rapper under 25, 24 inches on my ride
 Ball like 23 and I shot my first .22 when I was nine
 That's no lie, ho
 Rappers out they mothafucking minds so I gotta go
 Psycho on these niggas, call me Norman Bates with a poker face
 Got the banger in my hand and I'm out to poke your face
 .38 Special, grab it, let him have it, where the safe, we hungry
 Housing authority saved my Section 8
 My section be on the west side of Compton Cali, champ
 Where the killers posted on the corner like a letter stamp
 Let a rapper tell me I ain't better than whoever's out
 I'ma knock 'em out his Force 1's once I air 'em out
 Air jets flying 'cross the atlas, I made it momma, made a promise
 Married to hip hop, and the maid of honor gonna be R&B
 I'm fucking her too, so please hand me my condoms
 Where the honeymoon in the mother fucking booth
 You're fucking right, I'm the fucking truth
 I put my hand on the bible
 Swear to god if I lie, then I'll probably die tomorrow
 Tell my momma don't feel sorrow cause her son was a gunner
 They found my corpse with a rapper's head in my stomach
 I'm right here, I ain't running even if the Iraqis w-was in back of me
 Back against the wall I'm clapping them rapidly y'all
 Would never stop what you can't see
 It's like a red light when driving with Stevie
 Wonder if you can understand or withstand the blast of my wrath
 I steer the game with both hands while you crash
 Like Earnhardt my heart to the fallen soldiers
 You can either ride, or get rolled over
 Sleeping on me, I put you in a coma
 So please chill out before you meet the coldest
 Starving every day, see my face where the bowl is
 Bowl on my face, I walk while my mouth hold it
 Hold it
 I'm the best rapper under 25, 24 inches on my ride
 Ball like 23 and I shot my first .22 when I was nine
 21-gun salute
 And my soldiers killed 20 of your troops at a time
 And I got about nine teens on the corner fucking with marijuana
 Jive and heard about 18 rappers say that a bird can go for 17.5
 Motherfuck that my sweet 16s be equivalent to about 15 pie
 I was 14 when I wrote a rhyme
 All I seen was 13 ghosts every time I wrote a crazy line
 All these 12 bars in my verses, that's what Notorious and Pac arrived
 God dammit I spit just like a MAC 11 every time
 I drop jewels, you drop dimes, you pretending to be like mine
 I intend to put about 10 of you rappers on channel 9
 Straight up, fuck around and get ate up
 Cut 'em up in 7 ways, funeral carried by 6 in 5 days you'll know I go for
 Money when I sink my teeth in Carter III beats
 To you from me, my son the victory is mine, I won
 I'm the one
 The beat was the pussy
 And I cum, hard",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,https://i1.sndcdn.com/artworks-000410343144-2jckp6-original.jpg,,,,https://soundcloud.com/kendricklamarcompton/sets/c4-kendrick-lamar-2009,https://www.datpiff.com/Kendrick-Lamar-C4-mixtape.32334.html,,,,,,195,3.25,0.05,,Yes,3,,,,,,,1,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,4,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1,,,,,,,,,,,,,2,,,,,,,2,,,,,,,1,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1,,,,,,,,,,1,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Mr. Carter,C4,,3,4:12,,Mixtape,4,30 Jan 09,18,"I'm in the studio
 All day all night
 Cookin' up the flow
 Gettin' my career right
 As I should
 Tryna get my mama up out the hood
 So don't blame me if I hustle like I'm broke
 Cause all my life I've been broke
 I'm K-Dot if you didn't know
 Aiming straight for the top
 Hub City beat
 '87 baby '87 Cudi screamin' out ""Fuck the police""
 Bubble kush in the trunk, choppers in the front seat
 Get your top peeled back, don't chitterchat, don't speak of me
 I move low-key, I think like a double OG
 Inside of an old school bumpin' oldies
 So high off life, that bitch I could OD
 Die twice, and come back the same nigga
 Lame niggas get up out of my lane nigga
 Before the big rig come through and run over your brain nigga
 Me propane niggas for their dividends
 Forgive you innocent, Compton all of my uncles wore Pendletons
 West Coast rider, bitch I'mma ride her
 'Til the wheels fall off, buy more tires
 Mmm, say hello to the new prince
 I'm high king behind black tint
 Na'mean?
 I'm in the studio
 All day all night
 Cookin up the flow
 Gettin' my career right

 Tryna get my mama up out the hood
 So don't blame me if I hustle like I'm broke
 Cause all my life I've been broke
 I'm K-Dot if you didn't know
 Aiming straight for the top
 Get the fuck out of my business
 Because I've been handling the fuck out of my business
 Grinding got perfect attendance
 Flyer than first-class and detention
 Uh, been a winner since the beginning
 And my records show, not even in the Guinness
 What do you mean, am I finished? I'm just getting started
 But you're on the sideline like Vince Lombardi
 Weezy, new born baby? and it's my party
 And I'm kicking like a horse on the stick-shift Ferrarri
 Like new cocaine, bright yellow dope?
 Bright red flag like a red velvet rope
 Open for criticism, there really isn't any room for criticism
 When this shit is in I'm in deeper than your pool, so I swim in towel-less
 Bitch, I be and I been ballin'
 I'm in the studio
 All day all night
 Cookin up the flow
 Gettin' my career right
 As I should
 Tryna get my mama up out the hood
 So don't blame me if I hustle like I'm broke
 Cause all my life I've been broke
 I'm K-Dot if you didn't know
 Aiming straight for the top
 Mmm, fuck 'em all, kill 'em all off
 Send 'em off to the holy one
 Put a hole in one, like miniature golf
 Price on your head, and they trying to purchase
 No matter the cost
 Hand over the cloth
 Cloth over the gun
 Gun over your jaw
 Bullet over your tongue
 Stick my dick inside hip-hop and shorty's sprung
 Every time I get a chance to come over I overcome
 Over the snare drums
 They say, ""Who fucking with you if you the God MC?""
 I tell 'em none
 Get it? I tell 'em none
 Catholic nor Christian, holding the book of sums
 In the back of my True Religions
 Never passed the bar but
 I ain't got to study law
 Just to judge lyrics
 Mmm, I should be the judge of lyrics
 Bang the gavel, give you a life sentence
 I'm in the studio
 All day all night
 Cookin up the flow
 Gettin' my career right
 As I should
 Tryna get my mama up out the hood
 So don't blame me if I hustle like I'm broke
 Cause all my life I've been broke

 Owwww, Dave, I see you, now see me
 Look, I say I'm a millionaire
 I'm a Top Dawg millia- no let me just come in unorthodox
 I order plenty ammunition for the enemies that I got
 I'm the King, I'm just looking for my Coretta Scott
 Bet I pop, like a boy band, I'm annoying to rappers
 Guess I'm poison to rappers, front on me, get bent backwards
 Stomping on em' like a Kappa
 Cap and gown, graduated with my Masters
 So where do I go now
 Swear there is no-nothing after
 I'm the bishop, I'm the pastor, I'm the god MC
 And you don't want to get caught in the rapture
 I would probably burn your whole colony
 Chew you up then spit you out
 You nothing but a Polla Seed
 Follow hood policies
 Compton, California where the motherfuckin' riders be
 You never seen a killer 'til you seen one on side of me
 That green on the side of me
 Fuckin' all about my fuckin' money like a sodomy
 Fuck them bitches properly
 I do it
 I do it, done it, run it like I grown legs by the hundreds
 My pocket full of hundreds, I'm always hungry
 Been hungry, I think a nigga need three stomachs
 Bummy, never
 Middle of a conversation, I cough up a feather
 And get ready for the detonation
 I bomb on whoever
 Whatever you bout, I'm bout it twice like a woman who give twins life
 I steered right through your fan base every time
 Tapping your demographic like I was Gregory Hines
 Every line be tailor made, hella paid, count that money, several ways
 I'm a beast, fuck a mansion, I rather live in a cave
 Sasquatch is back, but what y'all really didn’t know is Sasquatch can rap
 Motherfucker, I'm iller
 Ok, I squeeze the juice out a rapper and just squash this track
 The people like ""What the fuck happened and where Wayne be at?""
 There's some boy named K-Dot and he's a maniac!
 I think his vocals is strapped, with a toolie, in fact
 He spit like a Uzi, rat-tat-tat
 He just shot me in my back, somebody pick up my back
 I think that boy from Iraq, I think y'all boys better know that
 He got it on lock like a Low Jack
 Heading straight for the top like a ball cap
 Y'all better fall back, y'all better crawl back where y'all came from
 Ain't one better than the one who can write like Langston Hughes from the brain off top
 Like a bottle dude, get a hollow, where you swallow food
 Get a model, bet she swallow, who? Me
 Bet she goggle like a scuba diver eyes in the sea
 Recognize who I be, K-Dot motherfucker
 Dot motherfucker, hot motherfucker, drop top when ya popped with the Glock
 On sight motherfucker, sight motherfucker, ride motherfucker, die motherfucker
 When I go pop, pop
 Open up, close shop like a retail spot
 Everybody know I be where the money lie, eat where the money lie, shit where the money lie, sleep where the money lie
 Bitch that's no lie, let the truth be told
 K-Dizzle, the Big Sizzle, turn beats to stoves, burn up

West Coast Wu Tang,C4,,6,4:22,,Mixtape,4,30 Jan 09,18,"Whoo Ha!
 Backpack raps with gats in it
 Don't get your cap peeled by the black menace
 K-Dot thoroughbred
 Move like a militant soldier, on point like a pyramid
 A forced to be reckoned with, fuck with the best shit
 Like the strongest manure, I'm ready when you are
 This is it, I'm in the lab cooking up all day
 Fuck 'em up all day like a nympho
 I been dope since S curl waves
 Trying to convince hoes I got good hair
 Knowing damn well there's chemicals there
 I'm in the hood with the 17 year-olds that's on hood patrol
 And they want stripes, so they shoot off bikes
 And you know any moment you can lose your life
 So kiss your kids and hug your wife, and what not yo
 I spar with a dragon, he tried to throw a flame
 But I ducked, then I stabbed him and came out the battle laughin'
 That's a metaphor for any rapper who wants it
 I smack 'em til their nose is running
 You know the hoes is coming if I'm there
 And the hoes is cumming once we hit the hotel
 There's no assumptions
 Cool out before I move out, hop on the 105
 Do about 105 before your ass gets threw out the back seat
 (There's a dead guy on the freeway)
 Oh, It's not Dot? Tell the medics it's okay
 A beast when the beat break
 You probably think I'm dope like this the realest shit I wrote
 But to me, it's a throw-away
 I stare at the four walls and rap like I'm mad at God
 Nice enough to throw a spear at Nas
 Launch at Jay, matter fact, let me take that back
 See I don't fuck with real legends in rap like you do
 I'm crucial, concealed by real crips and suwoo
 And they shoot like photography students when beef gets to brewing
 Is it real, son? Is it really real, son?
 Is it really real, son? Is it really real?
 Tell me how you feel, son, tell me how you feel, son
 Tell me how you feel, son, tell me how you feel
 You rappers got nothing for me when Sound-Sounwave record me
 Every MC, I'm sure to rip them, I guarantee you will forgive them
 Come again, no introduction, you know my name
 Soul brother, dueces suck the juice from my ding-a-ling
 Orangutan arms banging niggas like a set
 When I speak, they fucking silent like sex for the deaf
 Violence, I play it like violins in the orchestra
 Treat you like vitamins then spit you back out
 Like a verse I had way back before I had it mapped out
 Rip a page out the almanac then cross reference when I wreck shit
 I wish jaw bone fractures on all of you rappers bumping your gums
 Like the measles when the record meets the needle
 Heads spinning like a 12-inch, smoking the best Celtic
 Like I shot Larry Bird, follow my word
 Big Herb, Ill with it, I need a hospital gown
 You need 54 cards, deal with it
 You may think I'm killing it, but I'm healing it
 Like a bitch in the club, shoe game
 Ay yo yo, the flow potent
 Who's more focused? Kick doors open
 Deliver the golden opus leave with two guns smoking
 It's me, the podium closing, a poet well-spoken
 The gropes is most consistent with imminent penmanship
 Mind-bending, co-existing with the written
 Verbal assassin, Internally smashing, spazzing on tracks
 Translation, I'm disgusting in action
 A lyrical glutton busting over Sounwave productions
 Y'all don't want nothing, The sum of all fears
 Mercury rising, I'm summer all year
 I 16 'em to death and wish them the best
 I guess that's the gift and a curse, You see my pattering
 Y'all still rapping like that's what's happening
 I write rhymes with fire on stone tablets
 Peep the malice, I'm a monster
 Ya boy running like William Joseph Crawford touche
 Is it real, son? Is it really real, son?
 Is it really real, son? Is it really real?
 Tell me how you feel, son, tell me how you feel, son
 Tell me how you feel, son, tell me how you feel
 You rappers got nothing for me when Sound-Sounwave record me
 Every MC, I'm sure to rip them, I guarantee you will forgive them
 Straight up, Don't get ate up
 Put rappers in quicksand, Dot leaned on 'em like kickstands
 I'm so hot, kids put me in their iPod
 Even atheists play my shit and say, ""My God, Jesus, Joseph, and Mary, he's nice""
 Don't compare me to them, just compare me to Mike Jordan
 When I record and the verse and the chorus is ill
 You can land in lab of fortune when biting my skills, playa'
 Watch I lay-up bar after bar like I'm trying to build a gate up
 See me on the way up like an elevator, I'mma let you take the stairs
 That metaphor meaning I'm already there (Greatness)
 I'm in the booth with an apron
 Cooking up shit like Martha Stewart was my bitch, Amen
 Stay on the curb like a spray day tan?
 Blowing herb with my nigga Herb, Fuck what you niggas heard
 We the new West Coast Wu Tang bitch and I'm the best
 Think less, You can suck my dick
 Who from the West can kill it like us? Give me their name
 Now I take 'em to the house of pain, Top Dawg headquarters
 Is it real, son? Is it really real, son?
 Is it really real, son? Is it really real?
 Tell me how you feel, son, tell me how you feel, son

Phone Home,C4,,7,2:51,,Mixtape,4,30 Jan 09,18,"In due time I'm the modern day Albert Einstein
 I'm prime time like Deion
 And the rest of y'all is peons
 I pee on the best
 Whoever you are you can step
 Like a prosthetic leg
 I see monsters in my head
 That's why I rap with such aggression
 I tear down studio sessions
 Rappers scared, they walk in the booth
 With a bible and a reverend
 I use my mouth as a weapon
 Bullets rip through your mid section
 Rat tat a tat tat tat rata tat tat tat
 I'm a Comptown, nigga get a casket
 Go against me, that'll lead to my advantage
 Because I've got to eat
 And for real I'm feeling kind of famished
 Hotter than the earth core, don't show me where no fan is
 Show me where your fans is so they can see the real
 I'm sick and electrifying, that's double ill
 Me feel like me will be a legend like Will was a legend
 But I'm not an actor, put that in my will
 Gimme a second uncut coke lyrics what I'm stressing
 She want the raw so I fed her lines like Kevin
 Tell 'em I'm a werewolf, behold the 5'6"" bigfoot
 Lear jet overlook the country like Garth Brooks
 Lyrics on point, plus I got the right hooks
 Like Tommy Hearns, punchlines burn
 I'm not concerned about the SoundScan
 Cause most of y'all is drowning
 A lifeguard that's lounging
 Meaning I don't worry about none of you rappers
 I'm way more live
 That's evil backwards
 Now with that great word play
 I tend to let my words play
 Like children on a Saturday
 It's sad to say you're not up to par
 And I don't play with mini golf and sharks
 Jump inside the pool of sharks, we're biting off your head, your heart, your legs, arms
 Bled like Jay Rock or Big Wy
 And make sure you wear a vest
 Because they my family ties
 Suit up
 You got a three piece? I got a three piece
 A MAC-11, a 9 mili, and a DE
 He backpedaling like a DB
 I'm such a Martian
 Call me ET
 Always behind it like I own the TP
 I shit, fart, pee pee
 On anybody track
 Walk in the booth and drink down a fifth of Ex-Lax
 Wassup
 Now phone home
 My nigga Punchline is on, wipe 'em down
 Your boy carry that flame I am a arsonist
 I spit arsenic at you niggas cartilage
 Ill wip, drive by, niggas carsick
 20 on the charm
 VVS studded flawless
 Try and reach we specialize in garbage
 Taking out the trash put you underneath the tar pits
 How many times I gotta tell y'all niggas the big fish in the small pond
 I wail on niggas I'm vicious
 No, I'm serious
 Skip the birth canal and climb straight Cesarean
 You niggas ain't listening
 I'm not from 'round these parts
 I'm nonexistent
 Hit you with brake light
 Leave you missing",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,https://i1.sndcdn.com/artworks-000410343144-2jckp6-original.jpg,,,,https://soundcloud.com/kendricklamarcompton/sets/c4-kendrick-lamar-2009,https://www.datpiff.com/Kendrick-Lamar-C4-mixtape.32334.html,,,,,,171,2.85,0.05,,Yes,1,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,2,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1,,,,,,,,,1,1,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Compton Chemistry,C4,,8,2:22,,Mixtape,4,30 Jan 09,18,"Yeah, see, I know I can make a lot of money doing this, man
 It's just the whole process that uh...
 That I'm having trouble with, you know what I mean?
 I know you just, pretty much, you know
 Get the water boiling, and just, uh, get a jar or something like that
 Put it in the jar and just watch it you know bubble up and all that
 Shame on him! (what?)
 Lemme put my gloves on
 And my scrubs on
 I'm the chemist that's whippin' it in the kitchen
 This here is not for the children
 You need parental advision
 If you wanna learn how to cook in the dope business
 First you bargain shop
 Look for the priciest chickens
 I recommend that you pay Jorge a visit
 Got it wrapped in saran
 17.5 no, drop four grand, this is LA man!
 Unless it be a drought
 But homie if it ain't, then it is somewhere else
 Flip your hustle down south
 That's a whole other story though
 Back to the lesson, hope you're takin' down your footnotes, class is in session
 Get your instruments
 Grab some baking soda, a triple beam, a beaker
 And a hanger you can stir it with
 Split nine Os four ways in that 36
 Place it on the triple beam
 As hard as it may seem, it's not that tricky
 Say you'll get it baby, just bear with me
 Confidence before compliments
 Now let's get busy
 This is the procedure
 250 grams of coke, 150 grams of soda
 Place it in the beaker
 Your water should be boiling by then
 Grab a small cup and pour it in
 Twist the hanger until it's paper thin
 Place the hanger in the beaker then give your wrist a circular spin
 But hold on it gets tricky again!
 As your hand rotate
 You're probably thinkin' it's safe
 Until it starts to harden, slowing down the pace
 The muscle inside your arm is makin' your joints ache
 You're strugglin' on the job, but don't lose faith
 Wait...you got it back soft (good)
 Now pour some hot water inside the beaker jar
 The work should rise to the top
 Then pour some cold water on that
 That's when the dope should drop
 Snatch the cookie out the jar, grab a razor from the cabinet
 Place it on the cardboard, then chop
 As soon as the razor hit the work, you're happy
 You're excited that the chemistry worked
 This the fiend's appetite
 This bigger than life
 You turned to Mr. Nino Brown in one night
 You should thank me twice
 Though you learned from a chemist who never moved a brick in his life
 How ironic...hmm
 Like most of you rappers
 Aw I don't believe that man
 You're too professional with it man
 There's no way you've never done it before, you know what I mean?
 That was too descriptive",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,https://i1.sndcdn.com/artworks-000410343144-2jckp6-original.jpg,,,,https://soundcloud.com/kendricklamarcompton/sets/c4-kendrick-lamar-2009,https://www.datpiff.com/Kendrick-Lamar-C4-mixtape.32334.html,,,,,,142,2.37,0.04,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1,,,,,,,,1,,,,,,,,1,,,,,1,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Take Off Your Pants,C4,,9,3:40,,Mixtape,4,30 Jan 09,18,"K-Dot
 C4
 TDE
 I'm starin' at you and you look so good
 I want it in the back seat and on top of the hood
 And, I would do it all day if I could
 Put a lumberjack on and give you the wood
 You gotta man and that's understood
 But I gotta girlfriend too, this a mutual move
 So we do what grown folk do
 She had a new lit candle on the table for two
 A home cooked meal with the best soul food
 I told her ""Get on my plate, I'll just have you""
 You can sit on my face after I say grace
 Or I could just beat it up like I knew kung fu
 We ended up in the kitchen with a sink full of dishes
 Then I sat her on the stove like a pot when I hit it
 She never want me to stop when I'm in it
 Not even a minute until she finish
 Then I don't
 She works at the corner store
 She is so bad, so bad, so...
 I said ""my name is Soul
 Store me inside you phone
 We need some time alone
 In our near future, future
 Cause I am tryin' to bone
 Whenever your man ain't home
 Take off your pants, baby
 And come to me
 We done had all this drank
 We done smoked all this weed
 Take off your pants
 Dont be scared of me
 I won't hurt you girl
 I'll be your therapy
 When I come from out of that pussy
 And I smell fresh air
 You lost your voice yelling
 ""Pull my long ass hair!""
 Had the 112 Clan
 We could do it anywhere
 I ask her where she want it next
 She started staring at the stairs
 So we did it on the stairs
 And we took it upstairs
 Then we came back down
 When she came and she gave me
 The crown that I wear, right now
 Then I bounce like rubber
 Just in case her man come unannounced
 Send me a text message saying it was the bomb
 I send her a text like ""hit me when he gone
 So we can continue to creep.""
 And now I'm in the sheets 3 days out the week
 Freaks come out at night
 But I'm up in the morning
 And she up in the morning
 So we gon' fuck in the morning
 My only problem is running out of condoms
 She say she on the patch, but I can't buy that
 Knock on the door
 He isn't home
 Shes all alone
 Her legs so long
 Don't ask me whats wrong
 Ask me whats right
 Cuz I just wanna lay pipe for your info
 She do tricks on the dick this is how I know
 She make my whole shit disappear down her throat
 And this a trip, she don't even choke
 And I beat like a heart, she can feel a pulse
 Beat, beat, beat, beat...",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,https://i1.sndcdn.com/artworks-000410343144-2jckp6-original.jpg,,,,https://soundcloud.com/kendricklamarcompton/sets/c4-kendrick-lamar-2009,https://www.datpiff.com/Kendrick-Lamar-C4-mixtape.32334.html,,,,,,220,3.67,0.06,,Yes,2,,,,,,,,,,1,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Shot Down,C4,,10,4:23,,Mixtape,4,30 Jan 09,18,"C4, K-Dot, let's get it
 Yeah, Punch wanted me to come right in on the one
 I didn't want to
 I love this beat
 I love it so much, I can just listen to the instrumental
 And don't rap
 But I won't do that
 Light an incense for little Kendrick, little, oh, Kendrick
 Determination, my drive is like a thousand convertible engines
 My adrenaline pump the blood of a warrior, chump, the apprentice
 Grown to be a man, twenty-one now, my heart in my hand
 Don’t get gunned down, I’m from Compton, bitch
 Fuck a 6-4, we hit the kill switch
 The other day I seen my nigga Snows in the casket
 Darker skin tone, you can only imagine
 The type of shit we on, murdered them dumb bastards
 Kill 'em inside their kitchen
 And then stuffed them inside their cabinets
 Death before dishonor, put that on my mama
 I'mma ride till I see the promise land, that’s a promise
 Llamas in the unfamiliar minivan
 More drama only make more problems, but
 They gotta get shot down
 'Cause we riding, we riding, we riding
 They gotta get shot down
 'Cause we riding, we riding
 Like a black rodeo, .44’s, calicos
 Chop 'em up, stop 'em up like a stuffy nose
 We supposed to be brothers, motherfuck ya
 Tuck your tail, bitch, hell is waiting on ya
 While I’m praying on ya
 Not on my knees though, I mean preying on ya
 I gotta feed, ho, and your death is nutritious to my appetite
 After I eat, you’re sure to see afterlife
 Jesus Christ, forgive me for my sins
 Because when you forgive me, I’m sure to sin again
 I guess I’m a sinner, especially when I found out somebody killed my nigga
 Nigga, does anybody killer, fuck your creed, race, or color
 Son, daughter, sister, mother, brother gotta suffer
 Bitch, I’m cold hearted, till my arteries freeze
 Please hand me the keys to the G-ride
 They outside then
 They gotta get shot down
 'Cause we riding, we riding, we riding
 They gotta get shot down
 'Cause we riding, we riding
 Somebody get ready for a murder
 No more further announcements
 MAC-11 bouncing, the murder scene, coroner, yellow tape surrounding
 Either I retaliate or find self counseling
 Somebody got to die, simple mathematics
 Semi-automatic, watch them niggas panic and their hearts perish
 Or let's be diplomatic and less melodramatic
 Everything is vanity, think Ecclesiastic
 But what’s it all for, or what’s it all mean?
 An eye for an eye means you and I won’t live to see
 As our hearts bleed, we proceed cautiously
 Shoot them niggas down consciously, that’s how
 They gotta get shot down
 'Cause we riding, we riding, we riding
 They gotta get shot down
 'Cause we riding, we riding",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,https://i1.sndcdn.com/artworks-000410343144-2jckp6-original.jpg,,,,https://soundcloud.com/kendricklamarcompton/sets/c4-kendrick-lamar-2009,https://www.datpiff.com/Kendrick-Lamar-C4-mixtape.32334.html,,,,,,263,4.38,0.07,,Yes,6,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1,,2,,,,,,,,,,,1,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,X,,,,,,,,,,2,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1,,4,,2,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,3,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Play With Fire,C4,,11,4:27,,Mixtape,4,30 Jan 09,18,"Bitch, yeah, ha
 Compton most wanted, haunted by the ghost of the dead
 Climbing out the casket, with a bullet in the head
 All blue, all red, smothers every corner
 Catch 'em while they're young like the symptoms of pneumonia
 Good 'ol California, killa' California
 Where the violence lives, and the peace remains homeless
 Killers off the leash, at the mouth, they be foaming
 Mad dog mad dog, my goonies be some mad dogs
 I'm in the booth zoning
 Like 28 grams, of the good yams
 Fiends line up in the morning
 I'm cloning, greatness
 My words made of fire like I'm rhyming about satan
 I could burn through some braces
 If I had 'em
 This is the return of the dragon
 I'm not talking about, Bruce Lee
 I'm talking about, true heat
 And it look like you got cold feet
 Step into the flame and I might rekindle your name
 Point blank range, as I take aim, at success
 Put a bullet in the brain, then one more, in the chest
 I'm not thinking about no vest, that is not a factor
 I rip through that like I rip through a rapper
 I'm not a rapper, I am a raptor
 Dinosaur climbing on, everything that I perform
 Mayhem, chaos, they pray i, fall
 Victim of a fight, which is a gunslinging brawl
 But I'm all in all aware, that I'm rare
 Like a flying saucer hovin' through the air
 Kendrick don't have a spare, meaning there's
 No two alike, you can bet it, and I guarantee I'm right
 Like a freeway exit, I hope you get the message
 Before your T-Mobile lose service
 And don’t log off AIM on purpose, you nervous
 Ain't you, I'm ready to spank you
 Discipline the disobedient hang 'em like Willy Lynch
 Don't fuck with me
 I'm a furnace, burning, turn this mothafucka' inside out like
 Daddy mac, mac, daddy's back with a brand new bag
 And I'm talking about, mo' money pussy and pistols
 Students please get out your pencils
 I'm about to break down the principles of the game
 Don't complain because, it could be much worse
 Whenever you took an L, know that, you could be taking a hearse
 Ask you first, don't trust no skirt because bitches are the biggest liars
 You playing with that you playing with fire
 Burn
 Straight from the belly of the beast
 Break it to the police
 Said he put it on me
 I'm a ride 'til my wheels fall off with a G
 Ride with the P, 89 creep
 On him like a ninja, you entered the warzone
 Your home get bombed on, like an iraqi, and the policy
 A guerilla warfare, that nothing is fair
 We playin for keeps, no food no sleep
 I'm a warrior the coroner going to have to come and get him
 Put him under the streets, and I guarantee
 I hit 'em where it hurts, I'm a lurk where he sleeps
 His alarm clock beep, I be right there
 Gun then knife, dead kids, dead wife
 Dead bedrock head shot, I'm a hit him twice
 Then clear out the block, until there's no mo' life there
 Top Dawg ENT, bitch we right here
 We ain't runnin'
 We be gunnin'
 Niggas talk alot but they don't say nothin'
 Chop 'em up, slice 'em up, he a cooked onion
 Shake 'em down, break 'em down, throw 'em in a dungeon
 Don't wanna brawl with 5'6"" hog
 I'm a beast when I bark, every skyship fall
 Ground shall break, part the seas and the greatest lakes
 Anarchy is taking place, turn gorillas to bathing apes
 I'm a gorilla in every state
 Your opinion don't mean shit mind yo business
 Before I give your mind a business
 Ask matadors I ain't bullshittin'
 Bitches

 And hopefully I found her

 My nigga tells me 'bout this girl that he knows, oh
 Said she the type of girl that I'm looking for, oh
 Shout me her number and said make sure I call, oh
 Got straight to the point when she picked up the phone
 When she picked up the phone she said hello and I said
 A friend of mine said that you were the one for me
 A friend of mine said that you was with everything
 A friend of mine said that you are good company
 A friend of mine said that you got good pussy baby
 Got good pussy baby
 Can I sample baby? Cause I'm curious, curious
 I want it baby
 Gotta have it baby
 Said I need it baby cause I'm so curious, curious
 Now girl I don't mean to come off so strong
 But I heard that you got the love that I want
 Can you promise me that it's true what they say?
 Before you tell me your name? Is you with it?
 A friend of mine said that you were the one for me
 A friend of mine said that you was with everything
 A friend of mine said that you are good company
 A friend of mine said that you got good pussy baby
 Got good pussy baby
 Can I sample baby? Cause I'm curious, curious

 Said I need it baby cause I'm so curious, curious
 Tell me is you with it?
 Is you with it?
 Tell me are you with it?
 Are you with it?
 Give me that funk, that sweet, that nasty, that gushy stuff
 That coochie, that twat, that pussy stuff
 Whatever you wanna call it, I can't get enough
 I can be your lover, be your friend
 Be your number one or your ten
 Baby yell dress, and just like UPS or FedEx girl we can both send
 Then pray in the morning, then after we pray more play in the morning
 Have it your way like a shoe custom made whenever you need
 Or maybe like a chain of Burger King's
 I promise if we do it, I'll remain serene
 I truly understand
 Nobody gotta know like a group of yes men
 So momma don't trip
 And if it goes well we can make you a flip
 So what it's gon' be miss lady my clock is tickin'
 So please tell me you accept my proposition
 Are you gonna tell me now?
 Or you need more time if you do that's fine

 It's payday and I'm in the candy drop
 So for real, Candy Rain flooding your spot
 Firestone tires hot, burning the block
 For pete's sake I'm a heatwave melting your dot
 My ship sail, so I should move units and quick
 The whip trail like a mixed, variation of chips
 So when I dip, it's kinda ironic
 And all I do is hotbox Hydro, call it a carpool
 I'm from the west, where the Tec's is drawn like Cartoon Network
 Wetshirt, a marksman will become my ex expert
 Welcome to school fools, don't get an F for effort
 Top Dawg money gang, winter fresh, sunny chain
 Bad bitches
 Angry paper, got mad riches
 Who the fuck you think you're up against? Come again?
 Shades darker than the bitch, but I see you niggas
 And I, see you niggas, wouldn't wanna be you niggas

 Meet me on Central, and Rosecrans
 Goddamn, I'm the man, for life
 The left coast, bitch get it right
 Welcome to the C4, got the bombs and the rental
 It's Top Dawg
 They call me Rock, boy
 Shit I came a long way from selling rocks, boy
 'Bout my cash money, you can call me hot boy
 I throw shots, guns clap, like an encore
 B's up, hoes down, that's right blood
 Can't be street sweepers, get your ass mopped up
 Damn, I'm in a 2008 something
 Sitting on chrome buttons, nigga no bluffing
 Hit a club, all eyes on my neck
 Got $20,000 worth of diamonds on my chest, nigga
 Fuck VIP, I'm on the floor chunking up my sets
 Twisting fingers with my niggas, blowing swishers, sipping liquor, 'till I'm pissy, fucking bitches, it's so easy
 Get the name, tell them the telly nothing but pipe in their belly
 .380 keep it on my waist like a celly
 K-Dot 'bout to bomb on you niggas, get ready motherfucker
 I keep a big loaf of the toast, be careful when the toaster pop (Q)
 Hashbrowns and all, shooting out tater tots
 Around 8 o'clock I let it go for 8 a pop
 Taking off wigs like I'm working at a beauty shop
 I'm getting money, most success what I'm achieving
 Being broke is childish and most of these rappers teething
 Still whipping the stick-shift, bottles pop, big sips
 Green hash in the back, something to make my heart skip (damn)
 You ain't seen a dresser that's fresher and keep it ghetto
 Had a gat utter, sing to you; Reuben Studdard
 See my team rougher, y'all fat; cream puffer
 Your broad serve the whole squad, call her clique fucker
 Start to thinking that I'm the best, just sort of speaking
 More than decent, and fucking something that's Puerto Rican
 I'm cool as ever, not concerned about the weather
 Getting every dollar, I'm steady stacking my cheddar
 Hard as ever, y'all cats soft as a feather
 Super clever, outdoing me? Nigga never
 Try to fuck me out my cash, dawg I'm no pussy
 Got big cajones, my nigga you can't douche me
 Look, hard as a rock, look, yo I'm hard to smash
 New in-dash, bump loud, speakers blast
 Heard a couple of your songs, your whole shit was trash
 Fucking over the game, your whole squad is ass
 Yeah, I tell 'em, I tell 'em, bang, bow, pop the man shit
 As a young whippersnapper, been toting guns in my pants
 Niggas bitches, niggas snitching, yeah they taking the stand
 Cause a nigga on the block moves a couple of grand
 Coming in wild, with 32 guns, and 10 guys, 3 Puerto Rican bitches, and a couple of 9s
 Shit, BO never stopping, cause the flow is a headache, and my swag is a Oxycotin
 It's Top Dawg money gang, 20 grand verte chain
 Bentley GT, 3 pieces, nigga fuck a raise
 Hustle like I'm broke man, advise you to do the same
 Nigga rob me? Better knock it off man
 Shit, these niggas teddy bear soft
 They pull up to new coupe, watch me fucking knock their top off
 Bone marrow falling off, Mr. Swag dance, still lean, to the left, when they taking my pants
 Try to play this MC like he was light, cause you can get it worse than Harold did at that red light
 Pimping 24/7 like the day to the night
 Now you mad cause your girlfriend giving head right
 Moving through the block like a centipede
 No rooftop, who hot? I'mma show them where the antifreeze
 I hit the dealership, and tell them hand me keys, like a grand pianist
 Damage anything said, then landing on top of your bitch, oops I tripped
 I'm clumsy like Michelle Williams, or Jaleel White
 I feel like a Predator, and none of you Danny Glovers are ready for, Alien tactics
 The god is back, they're on their knees praying like a mantis
 As I perform like Santa Clause
 Pause TVs in the Phantom
 Bitches on my left and my right like I pant them
 Dancing on the coast, emerging from the smoke
 Pimping in my blood, tell doc to check my pulse
 They knew that was K-Dot the gemini, with another cut like a Samurai
 Anything else is uncivilized

G Code,C4,,15,4:01,,Mixtape,4,30 Jan 09,18,"Yeah. How I sound out there Ali? Good? Then good
 Can I pay my past a visit?
 Centennial Compton School District
 And video campus shut the fuck up your premises
 King Drew and Westchester had the baddest bitches
 And my nigga L Wood had a white Toyota, and we got pulled over
 Had to hide the bottle because there was mix with Hennessy and soda
 Every time we rode up we was unsober
 And everybody had know that
 My nigga Yan Yan had all the red P Hat
 Which was really dumb because where we was at
 Was the other side and more than likely
 The other side really didn't like that
 Didn't have no burner so if they shot us we could never really shoot back
 Could of lost our life over hood rats
 We was dumb as fuck but lucky for us we was lucky enough
 That the black car didn't pull up and ask where yall niggas from
 I know some, nigga less fortunate was fucking with the enemies' bitch
 She had a fat ass and a brown Camaro but it wasn't that fast it was like a V6
 But anyways she was one of those hoes in highschool with the cornrows
 Size 5 Jordans, Rolex sporting, and wanna fight everybody she knows
 Well she's important, well she wasn't, she was just so and so so and so cousin
 He was a red, so anytime she got into it, that who she would get
 Now let me get back to the plan
 Homie had ask, "" Do ya got a man?""
 She said,""No"", he said, ""Oh yeah
 Where do you stay?"" She said, "" Rosecrans""
 Rosecrans and what? She said, ""Don't matter just know I fuck
 He said, ""What? you're a, you're a little freaky bitch huh?""
 She said, ""Yeah daddy I can you get you sprung
 I can work that pussy and the tongue
 If you come over I can make you cum
 If you come over make sure that you bring drink
 Because I like to get to drunk.""
 And that he did, that Friday he was where she lived
 Notice that he was out of bounds
 But didn't give a fuck cause he wanted to fuck that bitch right now
 Walked in the house, rubber on, panties down
 Oldies playing in the background
 Let's get it on Marvin Gaye had bumped to the morning
 Time to go, picked his pants up off the floor
 Kissed that bitch in the mouth then walked to the door
 When he walked out he seen a 4-4 bluh!
 Didn't know that was the pussy he was dealing with
 And that's how you get your ass killed bitch!
 That's how you get your ass killed bitch!
 That's how you get your ass killed bitch!
 Get your ass killed bitch! How?
 Fucking with them hoes, them hoes, them hoes, them hoes
 Them hoes hoes, them scandalous hoes
 Them hoes hoes will have you uh dead dead dead
 Look, I guess we all can learn from mistakes
 But your first mistake, might be your death date
 And death doesn't wait, on no one
 A million ways to die, and you can make it a million and one
 If you not aware of the rules or maybe tryna fill someone else shoes
 Like a square trying to be a gangster kind of remind of this one dude
 He wasn't thirteen he was twenty two
 When he went to first get put on the hood
 He wasn't born it, Boys in the Hood the movie made him think it was all good
 But usually this type of person want to prove his s-s-s-s-self on purpose
 Tell everybody quit working, but really he's worthless
 His momma had money, his daddy had money, so he had money
 The OGs that gave him a pistol, think that he was gonna be just another crash dummy
 And the funny thing about it he thought he was 'bout it like P-Miller
 But he wasn't no killa
 Just a monkey hanging around a bunch of gorillas
 Everybody wanna be tough guy so he did, approached this guy like, ""Where are you from?"" with his gun but didn't shoot it, rule number one
 Never pull out if you don't use it
 Even though the dude didn't banged the very next day he seen around the way blew his brains out while homeboy was cruising
 Not knowing the scariest nigga will split your shit
 And that's how he got his ass killed bitch!
 That's how he got his ass killed bitch!
 That's how he got his ass killed bitch!
 Fuck around and get your ass killed bitch! How?
 Not knowing the G codes, the codes the codes
 The G codes, the codes the codes
 The G codes, if you don't know then your already dead dead dead

 Mhm
 Woo woo woo (she got some good head)
 Woo woo woo (she got some good head)
 Woo woo woo (she got some good head)
 Woo woo woo (K-Dot Valentino)
 When I get up all in ya
 Tell your girlfriend I beat it up
 So she can tell her friend I beat it up
 So I can get some fame, about my pipe game
 And slang my wee wee wee
 Wee wee wee
 Wee wee wee (that’s funny to me)
 Like a pornstar
 Wee wee wee
 Wee wee wee
 Wee wee wee
 Now they know who I are
 I was in high school
 Met this little bad bitch
 She had all the Jordan shoes
 Hair in a ponytail
 Earrings bamboo
 I said no disrespect
 Girl I want a sample
 She said, “You don’t know me yet”
 I said, “What that got to do with it”
 One week or nine months I’m still gon’ hit it
 Now admit it, you’re tempted, temptation is a motherfucker
 Now let your guard down
 I just wanna fuck you
 I’m hard right now
 I put that on me
 She giggled and said, “I’m full of curiosity""
 Well you know curiosity killed the cat
 So as we walk home from school show me where you live at
 Walked in, put the rubber on, then I killed that
 Walked out, she hopped on the phone, girl he did that
 Hm hm
 Her friend on the other end thinking how she gonna get a piece of him
 Preach
 When I get up all in ya
 Tell your girlfriend I beat it up
 So she can tell her friend I beat it up
 So I can get some fame, about my pipe game
 And slang my wee wee wee
 Wee wee wee
 Wee wee wee
 Like a pornstar
 Wee wee wee
 Wee wee wee
 Wee wee wee
 Now they know who I are
 Yeah, it’s Ab-Soul
 Used to fuck on my momma’s sofa
 Them were the good old days but now a nigga older
 I think back of when I chased that cat
 Like a horny dog, nigga wet dreams and all
 Waking up in cold sweat thinking bout them hoes, y’all
 No holds barred I would go so hard
 Sending bitches notes in class so much I hardly passed
 Hoping she give me the mule yeah throw me that ass
 I made her laugh
 Maybe walk her home
 Maybe get some dome
 Like Super Bowl Sunday
 And then I’m gone
 Off to the next
 Call her on the phone
 This was before text
 Carson High we was on them chicks
 Let them play the good role then we make them cake mix
 That’s a flip if you didn’t know
 Let the homie hit though
 Then she tell her girlfriend, then we let her join in
 Wee wee wee

Misunderstood,C4,,17,4:44,,Mixtape,4,30 Jan 09,18,"Baby you understand me now
 If sometimes you see that I'm mad
 Don't you know no one alive can always be an angel
 When everything goes wrong, you see some bad
 But I'm just a soul whose intentions are good
 Oh lord please don't let me be misunderstood
 As soon as the beat drop
 Within two bars, you already said I'm hot
 They savor, my fruits of labor
 My flow is sweeter than strawberries, oranges, and apricots
 God-dammit I raised the standards of the status-quo
 To go against me you gotta be more than professional
 You got to go extra hard like an erection with no protection
 And I be fucking all these bars
 We be sexing I'm a nympho
 For the instrumentals, all right, I admit it
 Matter of fact I got a hot date tonight, real rap
 Take this and take that from the machine
 Got this money up, with no caffeine
 Prepare me is kerosene struck by a bunch of lightning
 You looking at me then your sight seeing
 And what that means is that this human being is fly, don't try to duplicate
 I'm authentic, I see you scoping my style like forensics, that is foul
 Tech! Leave 'em by the benches
 I'm just a soul whose intentions are good
 Oh lord please don't let me be misunderstood
 I see the future better than your computers
 Apple software got the next 10 years scared I'm Fred Krueger
 Rugers on my hip, terminate all intruders
 Leave them dead inside the sewers
 Shoulda' coulda' knew I was a murderer
 Burning up the very sun, the rapture
 The god is back, they said he'd come, but I came faster
 I'm not an actor, if you play Denzel, you'll be thrown through a windshield
 The nine merely is handheld, the AK is hands on
 Now the battlefield I can land on one thousand mines and don't blow up because I'm the bomb
 Inside your CD deck, duck for cover, guard your neck, I demand respect
 If I never see a check, at least I got these rap niggas in check
 Preach Tabernacle fetch the Holy Bible if I'm lying
 King of my jungle, swear to remain humble, keep my vision tunnel
 Because I don't need to get sidetracked, my producer name is Sounwave and he gives me beats by the batch
 I'm just a soul whose intentions are good
 Oh Lord please don't let me be misunderstood
 My flow cold, like Aspen
 I love to show off when I'm in that Aston
 Look I act a ass, but I'm not jack
 A east side nigga I can get you popped at
 A hundred rounds nigga stop that
 You can't make that ass sit or flip-flop back
 I'm too gutta nigga top that
 This is lyrical homicide, not rap
 So don't get it misunderstood
 Say my name on your bars, shit I'm in your hood
 With 45 goons 45 shugs
 Chase your ass upstairs throw you of your roof
 I see you big dogs, all I hear is woof
 Loud talk, no bite, you niggas is puss
 I'm off that bubble kush, thinking about life
 Or how to make a mill and spend it all in one night
 I just might
 Snatch your bitch if she got a great appetite
 For the top dog catalog, that means everybody
 Several bodies on the shoty don't make it eight rappers
 Damn I hate rappers, don't call me that
 If you called it how you seen it you would call me real rap
 I don't fabricate shit, all I do is keep it real
 Eat, sleep, and take shits wipe me down if you will
 Hold up, big truck, lurkin' with the monster grill
 4 15s I got beat like Emmett Till
 Put me in my G-mode schooling every hot-head
 Tell them about the G-code, like eskimos
 My arms froze, popsicle

Young & Black,C4,,18,3:22,,Mixtape,4,30 Jan 09,18,"Sounwave, I feel we, put together
 Some of the most beautiful music my nigga
 Real talk, feels so good
 Let's get this money
 I feel like rapping tonight people
 Can I rap a little?
 Don't be mad..
 'Cause I'm young and I'm black and my hat's real low
 If you don't like my lyrics you can press fast forward
 Look, why I always feel that I'm hot?
 Why I always feel I should drop another jewel
 Like Martin on Blue Streak while you dudes get tattooed
 With permanent scars, I'm always bullying y'all
 I'm always righteous to think that life is what you make it
 I'm always thinking of R&B bitches butt-naked
 I'm always on point, like a snitch on the go
 But I never snitch my car's the only thing I towed on
 I'm always keeping it moving, middle finger up
 Like I practice celibacy, I don't give a fuck
 Just wait, I'm at they heads like a toupee yeah
 It's like that, your cranium never survive titanium bars
 Harder than my dick when the tip gets licked, quick
 Run for cover like winter's here then listen here
 K-Dot you'll never shake me loose
 Like a tied knot off the goose, you mad at me too?
 Cause I'm young and I'm black and my hat's real low (I can't front)
 If you don't like my lyrics you can press fast forward
 I can't front, I can't front sometimes I feel like
 Yo, why you always critiquing my shit
 Why don't you hop on your own dick like Marilyn Manson
 I'm dancing with 2 brains, so if I got shot in the head
 I won't die I'll just lose more game, propane walking
 You could sell my words at an auction for the right price
 And be rich your whole life, straight up
 I wanna see the world by 35 but for right now I'm Compton bound
 Hit Rosecrans with a pocket full of dividends
 Big truck speed through the light, run over civilians
 Pimp cut bitch on my right, hat low like a stripper ass
 When she hit the floor, doing my thing, why you complain?
 Cause I'm young and I'm black and I rap like a nigga got a
 Angel on his back, wait a minute I means business
 You homosexual with it, I give you straight lyrics
 Now that's an emcee, that's why you mad at me?
 Cause I'm young and I'm black and my hat's real low
 If you don't like my lyrics you can press fast forward (Fuck ya)
 Check me out
 What I write is a like a bomb device, press play
 And you can die tonight
 Shook ones don't exist whenever that K-Dot spit
 Off the chain like fast pedaling while riding a bike
 I gets my ride on, you ride too
 But like Scion, now that's a damn shame
 I'm hogging up both lanes
 Play your part, styles like Kevin Hart
 They're so plain
 I'm choking while I'm smoking on this strongest hocus pocus
 Chocking with Punch
 He sarcastic laughing cause I said that I can freestyle better than Kurupt
 Now that's a statement that hopefully I can back up
 See Kurupt is a legend, that's where I get my shit from
 Straight lab rat, spit it once run it back
 Like a punt return, they tell me wait my turn
 So that's what I'mma do, lay in the cut like a 2 shot Dillinger
 Killing these niggas in high pursuit waddup
 Cause I'm young and I'm black and my hat's real low
 If you don't like my lyrics you can press fast forward (Fuck Ya!)

The Heart Part 2,O.verly D.edicated,,1,4:54,,Mixtape,5,14 Sep 10,16,"""I’ll tell you what I don’t believe in, can I do that? All right, I don’t believe in laws, or the system by any means, whatsoever. I try not to obey them at anytime. That's what I believe in not believing in.""
 ""So what keeps you alive?""
 ""4 big bottles of water a day, 2 packs of Marlboro Reds. And, uh, I don’t - what keeps me alive, shit. Music, I have to listen to music all day long. I'd say that keeps me going. I’m a pretty dark person, I’ve thought about ending it a million times. And I have to say that music keeps me here, by far, the main thing.""
 Thank you
 Sitting in the studio thinking about which mood would go
 Right now, freestyle or write down, whatever
 It still'll come up clever, I just need to free my thoughts
 And Lord knows that I know better, but I ain't perfect
 I ain't seen too many churches or know them testament verses
 You should either hear me now or go deaf
 Or end up dead, die trying and know death
 Might end up dead, swallow blood, swallow my breath
 Fuck a funeral, just make sure you pay my music respect, nigga
 I mean that from the bottom of my heart
 You see my art is all I have
 And victory tastes sweet, even when the enemy can throw salt
 Still knock them out the park like a fucking tow car
 Let bygones be bygones, but where I'm from
 We buy guns and more guns to give to the young
 I'm living the life of a nigga trapped, nigga
 Inside the system all you envision is trap niggas
 My uncle doing life inside prison; he wasn't wrapped too tight
 He told me ""Rap about life, not rap niggas""
 That's why I'm shaking my head when you rap-dissin'
 My stomach start turning, my nerves get to twitching
 I start evaluating, then my final intuition
 Is that you wishing a come up, would just come up
 We used to beefing over turf, fuck beefing over a verse
 Niggas dying, motherfuck a double entendre
 And this is Comp-ton, lions in the land of the triumph
 Wrap-Saran our defiance, ban our alliance
 Put burners in the hands of the black man
 One hood with 20 4-4 like a cloned Kobe Bryant
 You probably heard I wanna be heard and wonder who I am
 You probably even listened to ""Faith,"" and think I know Zion
 But really I'm just caught in the loop, of understanding the truth
 Because it seem like it's always clashing with science
 I got a big fear of flying
 My future so bright I'd probably go blind before I blink twice
 I ain't lying
 I swear to God, half of y'all just don't know Kendrick
 The school of hard knocks, we was the first ones in attendance
 You walking down the block, he got shot, you are no eye witness
 You just mind your business
 You just turn your head, kneel down and then tie your tennis
 It's kind of scary, ain't it?
 You can't act like no bitch, that only got Tyler Perry famous
 Just let me explain this, why you pick up that stainless
 'Cause your pops wasn't anxious to see you and you hate it
 So much you probably had your burner tucked at graduation
 So if you see him on 'em bleachers then you kill him
 Facing 25 to life with a murder charge
 Your enemies was the prey and now you pray to God
 I pray these bars get farther than Compton
 And if our record never break, I still won’t break my promise
 I promise to keep it honest
 Secret society, all we ask is trust
 And all we lack is communication like service sucks
 The people scared of annihilation when Kingdom Come
 And I'm like, ""The Kendrick Lamar OD in less than a month, all right?""
 Gotta keep it pushing
 Can't let the government tell me how my future looking
 I'm on Rosecrans and Central trying to duck the central bookins'
 If the fucking pigs get behind me then you know I'm bookin'
 Never will I surrender
 I been a warrior when I came out my mom's placenta
 In the gutter lane like I'm Master Splinter
 How splendid, I guess my project had did it
 Got all these niggas approaching they mixtapes different
 They said seven tracks, I said 15
 Called it an EP, they said I’m trippin'
 But little did they know, I’m tryna' change the rules
 That we’ve been confined to, so the corporate won’t make decisions
 Uppity bitches handling business
 Killing our dreams, stealing our vision
 Out in Haiti, adolescents barely have a home
 In LA everybody think they fucking on
 Hop on Twitter, perpetrate we doing big shit
 Who we hanging with and bragging about the iPhone
 I swear to God most of y'all cats just don’t know Kendrick
 You barely know yourself, so I guess most of y'all should be offended
 Ain’t doing this for my health, I’m tryna' purchase my momma dem' Benzes
 Occupying my time with riches, justifying my time ambitions
 Just to coincide, just to go inside, plus we idolize why we living
 Look, the mastermind took the master's mind
 Just the perfect time, just to master mine
 Just to match the grind with precision
 Look, the mastermind took
 We would like to call this an appreciation tape for those who recognized the Kendrick Lamar EP. For this is the Kendrick Lamar OD.

Growing Apart (From Everything),O.verly D.edicated,,2,3:41,,Mixtape,5,14 Sep 10,16,"Where are we going, why are we slowing down
 Where are you going, we should be growing now
 (Smoke to it nigga, smoke to it nigga)
 Where are we going, we should be slowing down
 Where are you going, we should be growing now
 That’s what she said to me, that place I used to call home
 Is just a bed to me
 We don’t even sleep, neighbors can hear her weep
 Meanwhile I’m in these streets with everybody, I’m trying to get it
 And she know they got me, I watch her feelings watch me
 As they staring with the saddest eyes of loneliness
 Look each other in the face and barely blink
 I tried to make it right but the pen ran out of ink
 So if my letters don’t reach you, I hope these lyrics in sync
 Where are we going, why are we slowing down
 Where are you going, we should be growing now
 That’s what it said to me, but the place I call ambition
 Now dead to me, gone and forgotten, I’m off track
 Like Dale Earnhardt, my liver rotten, alcoholic tripping
 Fucking bad bitches and they got bad intentions
 Club night, guys and dolls
 Balling out but I'm 'bout to drop the ball
 I’m calling out for help, my engineer called
 Told me come to the studio but I wanna tell him, nah
 Where are we going, why are we slowing down
 Where are you going, we should be growing now
 That’s what he said to me
 But that place we call Heaven's unfair to me, only 144 can go
 Seven billion people on planet Earth today
 Is there something that I don’t know
 I know to follow Him rather following people
 Or follow vanity cause that means I’m following evil
 Guess I’m following evil, I should follow cathedral
 Blessings I need but live like I don’t need you
 Where are we going, why are we slowing down
 Where are you going, we should be growing now
 So in conclusion
 We all seem to stumble, planning our own demise
 Forgetting the big picture and making it wallet size
 So to what is important in my life, I apologize
 I promise to stay faithful, focused and sanctified
 We all get distracted, the question is
 Would you bounce back or bounce backwards?
 Would you not know how to act or take action?
 It’s just a part of life and if your vision’s impaired, you probably lose it all tonight
 Tryna visualize how to get it right but my vision’s so blurry
 Tryna slow it down, stay close to the ground, but we’re always in a hurry now
 And if I could make this world spin a little slower, then I would
 Then we could grow a little closer, I think we’re getting closer
 I think we’re getting closer",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,https://i1.sndcdn.com/artworks-000206155464-rs55tt-original.jpg,,,,https://soundcloud.com/kendricklamarcompton/sets/overly-dedicated-kendrick,https://www.datpiff.com/Kendrick-Lamar-Overly-Dedicated-mixtape.152921.html,,,,,,221,3.68,0.06,,,,Yes,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1,2,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

 Bad bitches, crackheads, street niggas, crack hoes
 This shit is so dope, you might wanna be my crack hoe

 Dope beat, dope flow, vary to me
 Especially when Sounwave is on his Ps
 Nigga cue me in I'm a Peruvian drug lord
 Don't fast forward, I'ma serve you some keys
 This is crack co-caine, I'm Kurt Co-bain
 And I bang like a C-R-I-P
 P-I-R-U, high you I'm a I-V
 This shit is so dope, you might wanna be my crack— stop
 I said a I-V cuz when I be in the studio, I shot
 A needle in your veins, take it in vein
 Or itch till your eyeballs pop
 I'm cold on the cold turkey
 I hate chickens but I do fuck pretty birdies
 Where your girl at? Over the Pyrex, where my world at

 Curl up like Big Worm when I drop

 That's Pookie on New Jack head first with a cyclops
 I'm the first one to do that I bet you never knew that
 Back like a tailbone, who you got to tell on?
 If ain’t about me about ho it be about face
 If you ain’t on higher—learning
 There's soda in the pot and the fire—burning
 This shit is so dope, you might wanna be my crack hoe
 This shit is so dope, you might wanna be my crack hoe
 Bad bitches, crackheads, street niggas, crack hoes
 This shit is so dope, you might wanna be my crack hoe
 Uhh, and it's scary to carry
 A smooth type flow like a drink of Merlot
 That'll freak y'all out like a girl Virgo
 When I turbo on any track, it's a Reynold's wrap
 And I rap like a nigga who invented rap
 Rapping heat, you can fall to defeat
 If you don't pay ya tolls like the limbs on ya feet
 I suppose this is bigger than life
 This is probably everybody, Illuminati
 Guess I'm the blood sacrifice of the party
 I undress her like a Harley
 Lights will flash, cars will crash
 Smoke more junk while the junkies laugh
 So my bad if I put you in rehab
 You are reimbursed, put it on my tab
 This shit is so dope, you might wanna be my crack hoe
 This shit is so dope, you might wanna be my crack hoe
 Bad bitches, crackheads, street niggas, crack hoes
 This shit is so dope, you might wanna be my crack hoe

 Oh, what up ho? Oh, what up?
 I said, oh, what up ho? Oh, what up?

 Well alright...
 I'm going through something with life

 Welcome to my diary, stressing got me gray hairs
 Something to inspire me, rather than society's
 Woes, let me go, let me shine a lil' bit love
 I want diamonds too, Ronnie on Player's Club
 I used to have a 9 to 5, fresh out of school that was '05
 That bitch was racist, got me fired, ever since then, I had no job
 Pushing in my momma van, stop for gas on Rosecrans
 Trust me these niggas rushed me for somethin my cousin prolly did
 Guilty by association: story of my life, nigga
 You gon make me flip and split yo shit, judge give me life, nigga
 Pain since my grandma's death, Uncle killed at Louie's Burgers
 Hold my tears I tried my best, let it go, drenched my pullover
 Cycles of a starving artist tryna go beyond the margin, margin
 Maintaining my modest modus as I dream
 So while I go through all this, all this bullshit what you call it
 Life itself, I know what helps, let me scroll through my Blackberry
 (""Hey what's up daddy?"")
 I'm going through something with life
 But pussy and Patrón make you feel alright
 Pussy and Patrón make you feel alright
 Pussy and Patrón, that's some great advice
 I'm going through something with life
 But pussy and Patrón make you feel alright
 Pussy and Patrón make you feel alright
 Pussy and Patrón, that's some great advice
 ""So what'd you rush me out here for?
 How was your day? Are you tipsy?""
 ""Mhm!""
 All I need in this lifetime: Pussy and Patrón
 Give me that, once you give me that, once again it's on
 Bitch I'm swagged up, hoes bopping when I'm off that screw
 Coming down clean, tell your baby momma what it do?
 Where your friends at? I got long dick, what it is?
 Go on poke it out, situate your little positives
 How I live? Big shot, on my grind, all ready
 I'mma lay it down like a carpenter when you let me
 Give me that funk, that sweet, that nasty, that gushy stuff
 I can't get enough, if I offend you, blame it on the liquor babe
 Give me that funk, that sweet, that nasty, that gushy stuff
 I can't get enough if I offend you...
 Uh, I wrote this song when Dave drove home
 And caught that flat, in the mean T Flats
 And it made me think if we could blink
 To change locations where we at
 We often get lost in the alcohol bottle
 In attempt to ignore pain, problem, and sorrow
 Just for a minute, then back to the bullshit
 Your car note due and you 'bout to get evicted
 Two drugs surely, Patrón, pussy, make it feel alright
 But once it's empty and the bitch leave, then it's back to life
 You can't run from it, gotta run to it, nigga
 The antidote wouldn't last and you knew it, nigga
 But still, you proceed to dive deep, ask what's her zodiac sign
 I'm going through something with life
 But pussy and Patrón make you feel alright
 Pussy and Patrón make you feel alright
 Pussy and Patrón, that's some great advice
 I'm going through something with life
 But pussy and Patrón make you feel alright
 Pussy and Patrón make you feel alright
 Pussy and Patrón, that's some great advice
 Okay, welcome to my diary, hmm, where should I begin?
 Finna get a swisher and fill it with at least a gram
 Crackers watch my every step, man I hate to work for them
 One time I tried to work for me, but that shit didn't work for me
 And here I am, stressing, questioning my direction man
 What to do? Nothing's moving, traffic jam, wiggle through it
 Pop the cork and take the fluid, bust that pussy open
 Bust that pussy open, bust that pussy open
 (Soul!) Balls deep, ya dig? Retrieve, relief, ya dig?
 Let's kill a bottle of tequila
 And lie butt-naked telling the truth, would ya?
 What's up? I had a long day and I really wanna fuck
 Take a double shot to the face and forget about my whole day
 'Cause all I've been thinking the whole day...
 I'm going through something with life
 But pussy and Patrón make you feel alright
 Pussy and Patrón make you feel alright
 Pussy and Patrón, that's some great advice
 I'm going through something with life

 She got me going, I'm all in
 Fifty stories, I'm falling
 Where you been? Is it planet Mars?
 Far beyond the stars? Are you a Martian?
 You're unfamiliar but still, I feel ya
 Energy sending me towards the ceiling
 I'm high now, are you up there?
 If you was, I would climb every other stair
 I gotta stare, I mean wow
 And I'm wowed, no one compares
 A 1-on-1, you must have won
 Every pageant in America when you was young
 Lips, hips, hair drips down her back

 Living in the city of the unknown
 I show her off, I stunt with her
 We do it sweet, they look bitter
 Look at her get up, I hear 'em say
 But why him? I hear 'em hate
 I laugh at it rather than jab at it
 Then continue eternal life as a crack addict
 'Cause I'm addicted, and you the drug
 Cold turkey? No sir
 You gotta be an odyssey from heaven and above
 You definitely know, probably I gotta give it up

 Hurt people that love us, love people
 I'm inspired, so get inspired
 And so he said ""Why you gotta be so kind-hearted?
 Why you couldn't be a con artist? Why you couldn't?
 Why you couldn't be mischievous or just a lil' devious
 The moment that we first started?
 Why you never ask for nothing, just a lil' time?
 Why you let me use yours cus I don't got mine?
 Why you always lift me up, when I'm completely giving up
 Or when niggas holla, ""What's up?"" you give a dry response?
 Why you giving me your last knowing you ain't got it?
 Why you always buy me something when you going shopping?
 Why you tell me that you love me, Why you always thinking of me
 Want my company rather than going club hopping?
 Why you treating my momma like she your momma too?
 Why you making promises that you'll forever do?
 Whatever just to make me happy, wanting us to have a family
 These are exactly the reasons why I cheat on you"" (Sometimes)
 We hurt people that love us, love people that hurt us
 We hurt people that love us, love people that hurt us
 We hurt people that love us, love people that hurt us
 We hurt people that love us, love people that hurt us
 Sometimes I, sometimes I feel we share
 Nothing in common, it ain't fair
 But where do we seem to fall
 Where do we seem to fall
 Tender love and care, once upon a time
 Once upon a time, we was there
 And so she said ""Why you gotta be so mean to me?
 Why you don't know what you mean to me?
 Why you always playing games? Why I feel like you ashamed
 Out in public curse me out and make a scenery?
 Why you got other bitches rolling their eyes at me?
 Why text messages popping up saying, ""Hi, Daddy""?
 Why you treat me like I'm nothing? Why you always at a function?
 I be wanting to go out but you don’t ever ask me
 Why you slip and say her name when we having sex?
 Why you always assuming that I still like my ex?
 Every time we get into it, I'm the one that's feeling stupid
 You don't need me, you gon' leave me, that's ya favorite threat
 Why you never know how it feel to be lonely?
 Why I feel I'm the last option after ya homies?
 Why you always gotta know that I will never let you go
 Even thoough you get violent and put your hands on me?"" (Sometimes)
 We hurt people that love us, love people that hurt us
 We hurt people that love us, love people that hurt us
 We hurt people that love us, love people that hurt us
 We hurt people that love us, love people that hurt us
 Sometimes I, sometimes I feel we share
 Nothing in common, it ain't fair
 But where do we seem to fall
 Where do we seem to fall
 Tender love and care, once upon a time
 Once upon a time, we was there
 She says she loves me
 She says she loves me
 So she clings to me, even when I want to be left alone
 But she's beautiful
 Like, sometimes, when I have things on my mind, she's the perfect person to listen
 And she only gives advice, she says, when I give her a cue
 She says she loves me
 Like when I wake up in the morning, she's sitting on the edge of the bed with a plate of food, wanting to feed me
 She says she needs me
 She says she loves me
 Or like when I'm stepping out of the shower, she's standing there with the towel, wanting to, wanting to dry me off
 She says, she says she loves me
 So instead of admitting that she has made another mistake
 She says she loves me... and I don't know about love",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,https://i1.sndcdn.com/artworks-000206155464-rs55tt-original.jpg,,,,https://soundcloud.com/kendricklamarcompton/sets/overly-dedicated-kendrick,https://www.datpiff.com/Kendrick-Lamar-Overly-Dedicated-mixtape.152921.html,,,,,,272,4.53,0.08,,,,Yes,,,,,,,,,,,,1,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,5,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,30,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1,,,,1,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Michael Jordan,O.verly D.edicated,,7,5:51,,Mixtape,5,14 Sep 10,16,"I used to wanna be like Michael Jordan
 Figure I would hit the NBA and make me a fortune
 Uh, every time I’m in my city, I be acting like my shit don’t stink
 Used to clean my Rollie chain with alcohol in the sink
 Riding around with niggas that I grew up with since McNair
 Bumpin' Me Against the World—hello, world, Kendrick here
 And I’m too much for these niggas, I’m three much for these hoes
 I’m too much for these niggas, I’m three much for these hoes
 I’m too much for these niggas, I’m three much for these hoes
 Wayne told me that and that's just how it goes
 Michael Jordan
 Bounce-bounce ho, bounce-bounce
 This shit make a nigga wanna get some bread or bust a head
 Or fuck my enemy's bitch, acting bad and getting rich
 Pull up on these 26s, I’m a vanity slave
 I’m a sinner, Jesus Christ, please forgive me for my ways
 I don’t know why your bitch want to fuck me
 And I don’t know why you fuck niggas can’t see
 I’m a Comp-town representer, a concrete back-flipper
 A.K.A that nigga, don't wuwwy!
 I don’t know why your bitch want to fuck me
 And I don’t know why you fuck niggas can’t see
 This is HiiiPoWeR, since the Eddie Bauer I been popular
 I’m popping now, every other hour paparazzi come
 You jocking her, let her be a ho, why you stopping though?
 We stopping the traffic, what you know 'bout them hockey pucks?
 Skating on 'em, why you hating on 'em? You should learn from 'em
 Seen too many of y’all getting money, know my turn coming
 I don’t know why your bitch wanna fuck me
 I don’t know why (Hey, wait a minute, motherfucker)

 Man, the game chose me, what am I to do?
 The only thing I did wrong was make it possible
 I diddy bop and make them titties pop
 Out there on my bumper like a city cop
 Walking out the Fred Segal, put my girl on it
 Ass so fat, probably sit the world on it (Aye)
 Pussy crazy, pussy crazy
 You fuck niggas, you pussies crazy
 Man, I know I can’t tell you about the world homie
 But I know I can tell you about your girl homie
 Her pussy crazy, her pussy crazy, I fuck nigga, I know you hate me
 I know they pay me too much of attention
 Bring my name up, it gotta be mentioned
 I need me an engine that go real fast
 Call it hall of fame once it haul ass
 Give me tall glass, Coconut Cîroc
 Please, no soda pop, I make my solo pop
 Life’s a bitch, her pussy crazy

 I remember tripping, walking through the set
 Like my Glock don’t think
 Grandma in the kitchen, neck bones in the sink
 I don’t know why your bitch want to fuck me
 And I don’t know why you sucker niggas can’t see
 I’m from Hoover man, high as Superman, shit you Lois Lane
 You pussy man with the pussy game, shit, we off the chain
 We popping the fortune, not the fame, shit, you backwards, man
 You chasing hoes, we replacing those, bag and pass them hoes
 Your broad done chose, guess she moving on, yep, we do it wrong
 We fucked her homes, fucked and sent her home, marijuana strong
 You know I’m gon' turn my swagger on, am I swagged enough?
 My paper long, yep, you left alone, y-y-you gets no fucks
 Leaning off the Actavis, passing blunts round and round
 Told me Mary was a go so we passed her round and round
 Your bitch texted me, wants it now so I had to knock her down
 Hurt her bouncing off my balls, slinging dick up from the mouth
 You let it slide, I hit home-runs, clean her dugout till I’m done
 I can be her number two and you can be her number one
 Her pussy’ crazy, her pussy crazy
 You fuck niggas!

Ignorance Is Bliss,O.verly D.edicated,,8,3:28,,Mixtape,5,14 Sep 10,16,"Lord forgive me
 Kill him where he stand and stand over him
 Shake his hand then jump back in that minivan
 Double back to his block and blam
 I ain't backing down for nothing
 I'ma back 'em down like Shaq
 With this black 2-2-3 in my hand
 Better pray that this chopper jam like a radio single, man
 Police radio signals saying that a 187 land on your corner
 Coroners comfort your momma
 ""Momma, he's dead,"" the next morning
 I toasted up with my homies, we drink and smoke marijuana
 Want us to change our ways? Uh-huh
 You see this game we play come from
 Uncles that raised me in Compton
 Ask me what I have accomplished
 I don't know, I don't have conscience
 I just load up and start dumping
 On enemies, I'm head huntin', no sympathy, ain't no love
 When you in these streets, just get something
 Protect your neck 'cause they coming
 For sets, respect, split your onion
 Then chop your deck
 Your head tumbling like gymnastics (Ooh...)
 'Cause ignorance is bliss
 Now everybody put your hands up high
 If you don't give a fuck, put your hands up high
 This the hardest shit you've heard from LA this far
 And I'm this far from a discharge, but never will I diss y'all
 We all tryna ball, and when I got the rock, I'll dish off
 Until the day I pistol-whip you posers 'til y'all pissed off
 Then peel off in a hooptie
 Come back and make these niggas wanna shoot me
 And they bitches wanna salute me or seduce me
 Indubitably, I'm too street—indubitably, I'ma do me
 Better than your bitch would, 'cause you niggas too weak
 But just give me two weeks and I'm good
 I'll make an album that'll put a smile on Malcolm
 Make Martin Luther tell God I'm the future for Heaven's talent
 No tarot card reading; I'm foreseeing you niggas vanish
 Not only from the rap game, I'm including the planet
 Cats so watered-down clowns can sink Titanic
 Tie titanium around their neck and watch 'em panic
 Give me respect, dammit, or get damaged
 Die young, corpse identified by your parents
 Apparently, you're a parrot, mocking me and my blueprint
 But I won't share it just make you cop it, then call you a sheriff
 Stop it, I'm hearin' the comments
 The critics are calling me conscious
 But truthfully, every shooter be callin' me Compton
 So truthfully, only calling me Kweli and Common?
 Proves... that ignorance is bliss
 Now everybody put your hands up high
 If you don't give a fuck, put your hands up high
 And this still the hardest shit you've heard from LA this far
 And I'm this far, from a discharge, but never will I diss y'all
 This my world, I grab the universe then play kickball
 And they wonder why these California earthquakes hittin' so hard
 I'm So-Cal, you so-called rappers need to go call
 Ghostbusters 'cause you busters are Casper when I go off
 I show up, to show out and show off
 You a hundred percent behind me
 And if you are, then wreck your car
 And walk up to my crime scene
 I remember bein' seventeen, wishin' someone would sign me
 Now the only way these labels get me back
 Is when they rewind me
 Backin' down bargains, backin' down bitches
 We gon' flip her
 Once she off that blue dolphin, you gon' tip her
 'Cause ignorance is bliss
 And Willie B, I'm a fool on your beats
 I bleed out the speaker

 Sometimes I wanna say fuck rapping, I need money now
 Like should I start trapping?
 If what I write down don't collect this very moment
 Then I'm on it, no question
 In the streets, my niggas is well connected, let's see
 Do I cop a pound of kush, promethazine or push some E?
 Oxycontin have me laying on soft cotton when I sleep?
 This is deep as the abyss, I'm not just rhyming on the beat
 I be in spots, chopping the rocks like Flintstone feet
 This is me, frustrated, battling my own evils
 Finna saddle up that work across Ohio in a Geo
 Or should I sell my music .zip to buy your zip
 And hope one day it flourish to a kilo
 Track record of a hustler
 Rather records on the needle, making music
 Clocking fast bank like a shot from Patrick Ewing
 My nigga, what you doing on these corners whipping?
 ""I thought you had a show?"" Well, my nigga, I guess I didn't
 I'm tryna get this dough, and easy money sounds tempting
 Especially when your homies pushing V8 engines
 Twenty-two on 26s, Range Rovers rolling up
 Three-fifty for an ounce of fire, I hope I got enough
 This industry calling my bluff, I need a new solution
 Curb-serving, or I might be in your store boosting
 2-11s with MAC-11s like fuck hip-hop
 Don't wanna be Pun, don't wanna be B.I.G., don't wanna be Pac
 Just give me your funds, AKA everything that you got
 Or everything getting shot, for nothing
 Leave you in shock, coughing up blood and mumbling
 Watch, the plans of a young man sponsor
 Moving grams like relocating your mom's momma
 Then expand to the Hoover Dam, water, sherm
 Contraband, they yearn for the butt-naked
 Fuck a verse, verses get let off in thirty minutes, six seconds
 I disperse to the world of unruly, where I put the mic down
 And pick up a sack and a toolie, if you knew me
 You'll know I always had a passion for riddling, writing
 But lately, I've been thinking 'bout taking chances to brighten
 My future financially, so please don't be mad at me
 I gotta do what I gotta do, no shit
 So I tell my nigga, ""Front me, let me put it on the strip""
 Then give it back when I think about the consequence
 Shit
 There are times, when you need someone
 I will be by your side
 Oh darling, cause there is a light that shines
 Special for you, and me yeah
 I-take-I-take-take my chances-chances-chances
 Before they pass, they pass, they pass
 Pass me by, oh darling

 Have you ever felt like, like you never get life?
 Like you never did right, sort of like a black sheep?
 Back down, backing out your dreams like some bad sleep
 Chasing for the wind but you never win the track meet
 Oh, what a cold world for a broke nigga, it's bitter
 And life's a bitch, don't hit women, so I bit her
 I struck enough pain let her know I wasn't playing
 I was so sincere like Nas' first name in Belly
 They tell me, it's very difficult to see 25
 And if I survive it's probably with a celly
 My opportunities are low because my brown complexion floats
 In the ghetto rather in some heels like Giuseppe's
 They want me unemployed, until I hit the streets
 Fulfilling voids of broke D-Boys selling weed
 Fucking up my prestige, 'til I live with the blues
 BB King or the neighbors of Snoop, that's why I'm
 In the club like fuck it, though
 They say it's only one life, life, life
 And if you say I can't live comfortable
 I'ma tell you that's a lie, lie, lie
 So while I hold this bottle of Ciroc with a hand full of ass
 Celebrate the very day that I get past
 Through the barbed wire
 We are, we are (Fighters)
 We are, we are (True)
 Through the, through barbed (Wires)
 We will, will break (Through)
 So while I hold this bottle of Ciroc with a hand full of ass
 Celebrate the very day that I get past
 Through the barbed wire
 Have you ever felt like, like you never get life?
 Like you never did right, sort of like a black sheep?
 Tryna get away from the world's stereotype
 Barbed wire got a barricade on your destiny, she desperately
 In need of some inspiration, see what the people saying
 She gon have a baby then flee from her education
 At the age of sixteen, credit card scam schemes
 See a scar on her eye, boyfriend brutality
 She'll never get by, no how, no way
 Welfare recipient, property of the state
 Housing, Section 8, corner store prostitute
 The owner bout to prosecute, the niggas tell her that she's cute
 Hoodrat trashy, 6 baby daddies
 And this baby daddy is new to the family
 Chilling in pajamis, waiting on the first
 Fast forward spilling drinks on her fur, that's why she
 In the club like fuck it, though
 They say it's only one life, life, life
 And if you say she can't live comfortable
 She gon' tell you that's a lie, lie, lie
 So while she up in VIP pouring Merlot in the glass
 Celebrate the very day that she get past
 Through the barbed wire
 We are, we are (Fighters)
 We are, we are (True)
 Through the, through barbed (Wires)
 We will, will break (Through)
 So while she up in VIP pouring Merlot in the glass
 Celebrate the very day that she get past
 Through the barbed wire
 Have you ever felt like, you finally got life
 You finally got right? No longer a black sheep
 Living off ya dreams like Christina uh-Milian
 In the front seat of a convertible eloping to get married
 What a feeling of overcoming the odds
 It's like we just hit the lottery, my God
 There must be a God, cause golly
 You done made it through the fight while squabbling Ali
 Now ya lifestyle's looking up and you escaped the crooked cuffs
 And you ain't have to kill a nigga just to make a couple bucks
 And she ain't have to go and fuck on everybody for a dollar
 Making good decisions, got a independent business-mind
 And both of y’all are steady grindin', doing it the legal way
 Just tryna make a decent pay on every second of the day
 But they won't give you the credit, disses out they mouth
 You must have joined the Illuminati just to ball out
 In the club like fuck it, though
 They say it's only one life, life, life
 And if you say they can't live comfortable
 They gone tell you that's a lie, lie, lie
 So even if you overcame doubt and ya living ain't bad
 Know it's a barbed wire that's always in your path
 Through the barbed wire (Just laugh)
 Then everybody say...
 'Cause I won't get caught again
 And I'm here to stop the trends
 You can catch me if you try
 Disappear into the night
 And I'm gone
 So you made it past all the barbed wires?
 There's one more left

Average Joe,O.verly D.edicated,,11,4:16,,Mixtape,5,14 Sep 10,16,"The hardest thing for me to do
 Is to get you, to know me, within sixteen bars
 That's the hardest thing
 Who is K-Dot? A young nigga from Compton
 On the curb writing raps next to a gunshot
 On the corners where the gangsters and the killers dwell
 The fraudulent tender scars that get unveiled
 Everyone I knew was either Crip or Piru
 Cousins in elementary, relatives in high school
 With that being said, each one of their rivals
 Was aiming something at my head, I needed survival
 Got jumped, got jacked, shot at, shot back
 And I don't even push a line, I'm just tryna push these rhymes
 In the midst of staying neutral and discrete
 My momma said you're judged by the company you keep
 But what you can consider, that if it goes down
 They'll kill you if you kill me, it gets deep nigga
 So if you ask what I'm doing
 I'm tryna duck the influence of my city that's brewing, real talk, and
 This is why they fuck with me (real talk nigga, believe it)
 This is why they fuck with me (do what I do, ya know?)
 I'm no gangster, no killer, I'm just your average Joe (know that)
 But one thing you should consider, I'm the realest you know
 I was walking from Centennial
 When an unidentified vehicle rolled up, and I was like ""hol' up""
 ""Where you from?"" I don't bang
 ""Where you stay?"" Westside, that's a Piru gang to be exact
 Well aware they had blue across they hat
 Dropped backpack and ran inside of the cul-de-sac
 Shots rang out, hoping to God I wasn't wet
 Crossed across Rosecrans and ran inside of the yet
 Chirped the homies on the I-95, they said they already knew
 What happened, and meet 'em outside the garage
 Never seen that many guns in my life
 I was paranoid like a fiend in the night, but needed revenge
 Grabbed the nine-ball, opened up the door, then got in
 Somebody said, ""fall back, we gon' make these niggas suffer
 You my brother like a frat, and that's just to remind you""
 Thought about that so long I had failed my finals, fuck, but
 This is why they fuck with me (I told you, nigga)
 This is why they fuck with me (you fake nigga)
 I'm no gangster, no killer, I'm just your average Joe (you fake)
 But one thing you should consider, I'm the realest you know
 I don't do black music, I don't do white music
 I do everyday life music
 Give 'em cuts like a nigga pierced a knife through it
 You say you through, but I've been through it, now that's cold
 And this is for my county building children
 In Hub City on hubcaps, no power-steering
 I use perseverance in this mad city
 Where the niggas drink Remy and hold semis for cutthroats
 Bernie Mac died, it's no joke
 Don't ask why if you don't know about these killers and thieves
 Seven grams of weed, you smoke that, but I'm high off life
 I could fall out the sky like twice
 And land in the land of the AKs
 And the minivans where the fan never on
 Cause it's hotter than a lunatic's underarms in a straitjacket
 In other words, we get it cracking, but I keep it cool, you know?
 This is why they fuck with me (haha)
 This is why they fuck with me (real talk)
 I'm no gangster, no killer, I'm just your average Joe (come on)
 But one thing you should consider, I'm the realest you know
 So there you have it
 But I'mma leave you with this
 An O.G. once told me
 A real gangster is either dead or in jail
 Or behind the scenes getting real money
 I'm gone",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,https://i1.sndcdn.com/artworks-000206155464-rs55tt-original.jpg,,,,https://soundcloud.com/kendricklamarcompton/sets/overly-dedicated-kendrick,https://www.datpiff.com/Kendrick-Lamar-Overly-Dedicated-mixtape.152921.html,,,,,,256,4.27,0.07,,Yes,3,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1,,,,,,,,,,,,,2,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,X,,,,,,,,,,,,,1,,,1,1,,,,,,,1,,,,,,,7,,,,,,,1,,2,1,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1,,,,,,,,1,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

 All the real smokers get me H.O.C.
 H.O.C., H.O.C.
 All the real smokers get me H.O.C.
 All the real smokers get me H.O.C.
 Everybody know I spit that other shit
 Shit that make you duck for cover shit
 Shit that make you hop out your seat and slap your mother shit
 Especially when Drop drop the beat
 I drop jewels like my nuts dropped out of my briefs
 Jump in the booth and shatter every rapper's dream
 They jump in a sauna because I killed their self-esteem
 That's a jab, you should bob and weave
 Like Pam when Martin pulled jokes out his sleeve
 I go in studio sessions and feel like a nerd
 Cause I'm the only nigga there not smoking no herb
 You telling me the kush make you think on level four?
 I'm on five, you saying that I can level more?
 In high school, my teachers thought I was smoking stress
 Didn't know my eyes low cause of genetic defects
 I stimulate my mind every time I think about the end of time
 Creation of man, and Columbine
 Bet you think that this some high shit that I wrote
 Probably think I'm off the kush or the hydro
 (Nope) I don't even smoke, I don't even smoke
 I don't even smoke, I don't even smoke
 I really appreciate that you share your Indo
 But a sip of Henny is the farthest I would go
 I don't even smoke, I don't even smoke
 I don't even smoke, I don't even smoke
 Look, nowadays everybody think they're big chiefers
 Just cause they heard that new tape from Wiz Khalifa
 Knowing damn well they can't hit the sour
 They're new booties, they probably need baby powder
 My skill shower over your city for 40 days
 40 nights, off the chain, like freedom of slaves
 Before you get it twisted, like 40 gays
 My flow worth the earth, that's not to be appraised
 Those the type of lines that I'm talking 'bout
 You know the type of rhymes you don't talk about
 Copy my session on a disc when the session ends
 So my momma can have it and play it for her friends
 Brag on me, like ""My son's 'bout to win
 Somehow, someday, and I don't care when""
 I might hit the gin once a month
 I'll let you inhale, like an atheist
 Bet you think that this some high shit that I wrote
 Probably think I'm off the kush or the hydro
 (Nope) I don't even smoke, I don't even smoke
 I don't even smoke, I don't even smoke
 I really appreciate that you share your Indo
 But a sip of Henny is the farthest I would go
 I don't even smoke, I don't even smoke
 I don't even smoke, I don't even smoke
 I'll take you back to the 9th grade
 When Dough Boy had me high for 4 days
 That's my nigga, he a street nigga
 Probably in your hood, fucking up your street, nigga
 But anyway I think it was some purple
 Told me ""Don't hit it hard because it'll hurt you""
 I didn't listen, I was floating like the Rose Parade
 Swear to God a nigga seen some flying fishes
 That was the Vegas trip, Hooters sponsored
 The same time I start writing like a fucking monster
 I'm Frankenstein every time this mothafucker ponders
 Just underline every letter, capital K-D-O-T
 Laying it flat out, like a tire with slow leaks
 Now what you 'bout? Nothing huh
 Am I a square cause I don't puff a square?
 Are my raps too blunt to hit the blunt? Yeah
 Bet you think that this some high shit that I wrote
 Probably think I'm off the kush or the hydro
 (Nope) I don't even smoke, I don't even smoke
 I don't even smoke, I don't even smoke
 I really appreciate that you share your Indo
 But a sip of Henny is the farthest I would go
 I don't even smoke, I don't even smoke

Cut You Off (To Grow Closer),O.verly D.edicated,,13,6:04,,Mixtape,5,14 Sep 10,16,"Ali, you thirsty on Twitter!
 You boo-boo, you Td
 You turned down, you thirsty
 You boo-boo!
 Uh, I'm tryna learn something new
 I'm tryna find myself, I'm searching deep for Kendrick Lamar
 I read about Napoleon Hill and try to know God
 They say he the key to my blessings, and if I speak the good
 Into existence, that instant my dreams will unlock
 Money flow like water, I'll just wait at the dock
 And by the way I'ma start, finding more light to shed
 Like a small garage in your backyard
 I'm back chilling with a friend of mine, she mighty fine
 But I notice that her heart resides next to bitterness
 Always hollering who she don't like and who she kick it with
 Who she wanna fight, who wearing a weave
 Who Dooney and Bourke bag is fake, who holding the keys
 To the car she drove last year or who fucking on who
 And who need a pap smear, getting on my nerves
 But before your negative energy curve, bitch I'ma cut you off
 'Cause every time you come around
 You be hollering that whoop-de-whoop, blah-zay-blah
 He say, she say, oh my God
 Shut the fuck up... hoe
 Every time you come around
 You be hollering that whoop-de-whoop, blah-zay-blah
 He say, she say...
 Uh, I'm tryna learn something new
 I'm tryna surround myself with people that inspire me
 Or at least inquire similar desires
 To do what it T-A-K-E just to reach the T-O-P
 I'm talking ideas, motivation
 It's more than making, enemies, my nigga
 Oh, that's not ya memo? Then tell me why you constant stressing
 On how you well connected like centipedes, my nigga
 I function with you and you flaunt your pistol
 Every second tell me how you pressed 'em at the Monte Cristo
 Where so and so from, and what neighborhoods beefing
 Who baby momma's a rat, and who got killed last weekend
 That shit is mad depressing, bringing me down
 Speak on somethin' with some substance that can get us both paid
 Rather than telling me how these niggas jocking your style
 Or his rims ain't bigger, pussy nigga, I'ma cut you off
 'Cause every time you come around
 You be hollering that whoop-de-whoop, blah-zay-blah
 He say, she say, oh my God
 Shut the fuck up... scary ass
 Every time you come around
 You be hollering that whoop-de-whoop, blah-zay-blah
 He say, she say
 Uh, I'm tryna learn something new
 I'm tryna better my chances of becoming a star
 I'm tryna feel the vibe of Mona Lisa
 Studying art... now paint that picture
 Life behind bars, remember the very day I got caught?
 I murdered a rapper, and you filed the police report?
 See what I was taught, family is all I need
 But indeed them too can run me right up a tree
 Constantly talking shit 'bout the next relative
 Wanting me to take sides, but I'd never give in
 Ever since grandma died, everyone parted ways
 Argue on holidays, left my uncle in prison
 For 15 years, no one paid him attention but moms
 Yeah, my momma as loyal as any sister would come
 Come to my house just to yap about your own people
 Dang, and if your blood wasn't running through my veins
 I would prolly cut y'all off too, yep
 'Cause everytime y'all come around
 Y'all be hollering that whoop-de-whoop, blah-zay-blah
 He say, she say, oh my God, shut the fuck up
 Keep it running, Ali
 Every time you come around
 You be hollering that whoop-de-whoop, blah-zay-blah
 He say, she say
 So tell 'em, ""Shut the fuck up!""
 Tell 'em, ""Shut the fuck up!""
 Yeah, bitch, you boo-boo, you T'd
 You turnt down, you thirsty
 Tell 'em ""Shut the fuck up!""
 Tell 'em ""Shut the fuck up!""
 Yeah, nigga, you boo-boo, you T'd
 You turnt down, you thirsty
 You thirsty, you boo-boo
 You T, you turnt down
 You boo-boo, you T'd
 You boo-boo, you turnt down
 You thirsty, you T'd
 You boo-boo, you turnt down
 You boo-boo, you T'd
 You turnt down, you weak
 You weak, yo’ bitch weak
 Yo- (laughs)
 You boo-boo, you T (laughs)
 Keep all that
 What is HiiiPoWeR?
 HiiiPoWeR is the way we think, the way we live
 See it’s known today that the human race is nothing
 No morals, no standards
 What we’re about to do is raise the level of expectations
 No, you don’t have to have a lot of money
 You don’t have to be rich
 But you will be rich in mind and spirit
 Some say it’s as big as a crew, some say it’s as big as a gang
 HiiiPoWeR, we stand for it as if it’s as big as a religion",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,https://i1.sndcdn.com/artworks-000206155464-rs55tt-original.jpg,,,,https://soundcloud.com/kendricklamarcompton/sets/overly-dedicated-kendrick,https://www.datpiff.com/Kendrick-Lamar-Overly-Dedicated-mixtape.152921.html,,,,,,364,6.07,0.1,,Yes,2,Yes,2,,,,,,,,,1,,,,,,,,,,,,,1,,,,,,,1,,,,,1,,,,,,5,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,4,1,,,3,,,1,,,,,,,2,,,3,,,,,,,,,,,3,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

 Niggas hatin', bitches hatin', babies dyin'
 Bullets flyin', helicopters, police sirens, preachers lying
 Genocism, criticism, unemployment, racism
 Burning buildings, AIDS victims, cancer killin' no cure
 Oil spillin', turmoil, poverty-stricken, police brutality
 Kickin' ass of us Africans, hostages in Afghanistan
 Not to mention another prison, child molesting
 Cow intestines, Botox injections, earthquakes that's government tested
 Secret society weapon, opium plant manifested
 Then turn to crack then invested amongst us Blacks just a message
 To hold us back, great depression amongst Iraq, no direction no Google map
 Just a Tec for the soo-woop swerving, izuzu then blap blap blap
 Adolescents go coocoo, mothers are boohoo crying
 The governor keeps us starvin', these commercials keep us buyin'
 These cigarettes supermarkets fill up our liver with triumph
 Distincted livin' with science, no place to live in, no Zion
 See that's forbidden, we fryin'

 Tell it like it is nigga, tell it like it is homeboy

 Get undressed, yeah, Dom (Uh)
 Yeah, Dom, what you need?
 Some bomb head? A bag of weed? (Bomb head, yeah)
 Good food? Japanese? (Yeah, yeah)
 That's me on page forty in that magazine
 Dom Kennedy, you need that
 She said nobody come close, I agreed back (Uh)
 I'm the nigga who used to help her pull that weave back (Yeah)
 And she need me, believe that (Yeah)

 Remember dinner dates I was late? Mr. Chows (Uh-huh)
 Truant like a student, you the principal (Alright)
 Schooled me on timing, we was both shining (Alright, alright)
 Like the sun bouncing off the brightest blood diamond (True)
 I was Your Highness, you was my queen (Uh-huh, uh-huh)
 You got over him when I got in between
 Watching Martin on TBS as it was tedious
 For us to eat TV dinners every time we was famished
 But it was such a pleasure to watch you try to hold it together
 Every time I put the head in you would panic
 And come right down like an avalanche
 Make your legs slant, whisper till you juicing up your pants
 Baby how that sound? Kosher, no sir
 Wake it back up, Folger's holsters
 By my waistline, shot for your heart
 And you called it a hate crime, say you want me back
 And your girl wanna date Dom, that's high school shit
 401K, we could be friends with benefits, you dig that?
 That girl is smoking
 And can you believe that I'm her focus?
 It ain't hard to see she got me open
 And together, we are roller-coasting, on, on, on
 I upped and walked out, now she crying 'cause
 She need me, I got that Jon Brion love
 Had to find love, we called it punch-drunk
 We was a two-piece, she was a one-punch
 You know, a knock-out, and if she was to walk out
 My heart would go black, shrivel up and drop out
 There we go again, what the fuck you talking 'bout?
 We used to fuck all the time back at my momma's house
 Smoking beedies, laying on the futon
 Memories I got saved up like a coupon
 And we'd be too gone off a sack of stress weed
 I was broke then, couldn't cop the best weed
 Then she would just leave in a black hatchback
 Homies from the hood used to ask me if I'd tapped that
 I would say, ""Yep,"" smiling so freely
 That was back then, but I bet she still need me
 She need me, she need me
 She need me, she need me
 I would say ""Yes,"" smiling so freely
 That was back then, I bet she still need me
 That girl is smoking

 Now I prefer women with some sexy toes
 With no corns but enjoys eating vegetables
 Seem like everybody love the role of assholes
 But I'm feeling better being crowned with some bad hoes
 Mr. Michael of Amish yo speaking
 Fedora on the top, the black Abraham Lincoln
 I hear they fell in love with my penis
 Only concerned with my balls like Venus
 Huh, they say I'm rolling like a big shot
 Kama Sutra missionary, fuck shit up on top
 Say, I'm big time, Flavor Flav on a wristwatch
 And all these chickens want that rooster, call it Big Cock
 Co-co-co-cock that, aim and shoot that sure shot
 U-N-I, T.D.E. be doing it so go head and hop
 On that bandwagon of my genitals, not new to me
 I’m still serving, broads on my TIP for gratuities

 So when it come to stunting, bitch I do it
 Never been like you or wanted to be, I do me
 She found out that I'm in a group, now she's a groupie
 Don't need a watch that's full of diamonds to know that it's perfect timing
 We be shining blue and brown and got that golden Gucci
 Yeah, keep it simple stupid, all I see is trendy all around me
 T.D.E. the movement, we Sore Losers out of Dallas County
 Country accent, city fashion, lights are flashing on the cameras
 Hoes are choosing, niggas' hating, we ain’t tripping, keep our balance

 That's the chaos, comes from K. Dot swinging swords and hanging nooses
 Chucking deuces, then drop one, dropping music and I won
 Call me hot or call me Pac, every eye on me and it's obviously
 I'm close as next to kingdom come, I just run my city dude
 You just make your city run, they hate to be next to you
 Tables turn, say you earn rights to be the God MC
 I'm 'bout to make that halo burn, now goddamn that's some irony
 I am the messiah of society
 Beside a Halle Berry, feed me berries in Paris, oui-oui
 I carry on a great endeavor, ambition leave all men grief

The Heart Part 1,The Heart Part 1,,1,4:05,,Single,,14 Apr 10,1,"Uh
 A lil' Compton nigga
 Just a lil' Compton nigga
 One time for my niggas
 You know Compton, nigga
 Just a lil' Compton nigga
 Kendrick Lamar
 Back with a vengeance
 Back with my heart and I'm venting
 Back with another war pendant, salute me or shoot me
 I never wore a kufi, ignore my religion
 I believe there's one God, there's one love
 And I believe if I fly, we all doves
 I make a way for my people to see the light
 Brighter than yellow bones
 Me and my microphone could be one
 Until I see BIG, Pac, see Pun but this ain't Eazy
 I can't take a Big L, my city needs me, I gotta win
 The proof is in the pudding
 And I been fucking with Cosby since I was ten, you damn right
 Any means necessary, get the campaign right
 Very emotional I'm a Gemini, I love hard and I fight harder, a born author
 A born starter, in the game for real
 And the games appeal to the struggling youth with no father
 You can't learn if mistakes ain't made
 You gotta pay your homage in order to get paid
 You gotta pay attention in order to pay dues
 And you ain't gettin' it, 'til you start payin' Jews
 Lifestyles of the young and the broke
 With my hand under oath, I recite these quotes
 And if I ever lie then I die where I stand as a pest not a man what I wrote through a rap
 In order to see the front, I had to play the back
 We played our position, we let y'all play y'all self, y'all made y'all decision
 We pray while we prey on competition
 To flip another page of Corinthians
 I see stars when I write these sentences
 Words crash cars when I write these sentences
 Open jail bars for my niggas' life sentences
 Free J-Dove, kill all witnesses
 Y'all better hope 2012 really real, cause the way I feel I'ma make y'all suffer
 And take y'all supper
 I haven't ate in the last 22 summers and I'm 22 now it's about to go down
 So en garde, my God we got these artists in awe
 Oh, I'm free
 Finally I can say I'm me
 The Kendrick Lamar EP, classic EP
 The question concerns
 I dropped it and gave the whole world my germs
 Hope y'all infected
 Hope y'all ain't have no protection
 Still I'm progressing, room for improvement
 Make room for the groom married to his music
 I was at the XXL just trying to excel
 Networking, meanwhile my stomach turning
 Wanted to be a part of it cater it to my audience
 J. Cole runnin' late
 If he don't show up, think I can take his place
 Ladies start laughing
 No pun intended I ain't being sarcastic
 Homie popped up with about twenty bags and
 Fresh out the plane I couldn't even complain
 My nigga was on his hustle I introduced him my name
 Said I'll see him on the bubble in the future, my dude I salute ya
 Contributing the real shit
 Talk about it make the people talk about it
 Make the world see, for every MC that I see tryna stay afloat
 Tell 'em build a boat like Noah
 And take him to a place that I'm sure we all can blow up, boom
 I ain't a star yet but I'm gettin' close to 'em
 And if you see a whack artist do more than boo him
 Throw him off the banister, shoot him on camera
 Then kill his manager
 Then hang a banner up, that reads you can't proceed without bein' conceived by one album of the 90's
 On Rosecrans where you'll find me
 And all my niggas is grimy
 But I remain the good kid
 Tryna make a difference where I'm from, where you live
 Oh no we got to slow the city down
 I told the homeboy pump his brakes
 He said that he rather put the pump to his face
 Sawed off
 Torture, turn the saw off, its scorchin'
 Hot where I'm from, the newscasters don't come
 Another ratchet got dumped, in the trashcan I ain't done
 A baby in there with it
 She said postpartum did it
 Molested at eleven and she always reminiscing
 When he was undressing said it'll only be a minute
 That's why I always think I'm kicking something with feeling
 I should've been a dentist
 I should've been a blizzard-cold
 Flash, pose, flash, pose, a critic paparazzi got me on my toes
 I wanna jump on him like a tad-pole, tad-pole, ass-holes
 Tryna kill my dreams
 Not elevate
 Those are not my dreams, I'll be straight
 With a little bit of passion
 And a drive like an Aston
 Motivation from Nipsey or Glasses, Jay Rock
 Mykestro , Bad Lucc, U-N-I
 Dom Kennedy, Murs and Fashawn
 Lady G, Willy B in time
 I'ma blow like I'm mothafuckin' sniffing lines
 Go like I never seen a red light shine
 Flow to my heart, hit the flo' when I'm dying
 Heart of a lion, tell 'em get in line
 And pass the baton, I won't pass it back I ain't good at dimes
 If the bitch bad I could pass you a dime
 Haters better duck like I'm passing a pond
 Know I'm the king and I'm passing you pawns
 Pad on the hill (as in a big house on the hill) that's a passion of mine
 Problem is I shine like two mics under heavy strobe lights
 I'ma need two mics just to get my point across
 I'ma get my joint across, country y'all gon' want me
 P—

The Heart Part 3 (Will You Let It Die?),The Heart Part 3,,1,4:37,,Single,,20 Oct 12,1,"One two, one two, one two
 One two, one two, one two
 One two
 Turn the headphones up Ali
 One two
 You mix with Dre, right?
 Turn the headphones up
 When the whole world see you as Pac reincarnated
 That's enough pressure to live your whole life sedated
 Find the tallest building in Vegas and jump off it
 But I could never rewrite history in a coffin
 So I'm talking to God, ""Can you wash all these demons off me?""
 This last year I've been quite similar to Aaliyah
 Control my own destiny, only rapper that steered
 A G5, g's give high-fives to me and say, ""Kendrick, just persevere
 The presence of being real""
 As I lay in this four corner room staring at candles
 Thinking, ""How can I make an example for this generation of Compton?""
 My biggest fear is not feeling accomplished
 Or turning back to that same accomplice
 My past life was a child with no act right
 Trying to smile in a room of killers, turn into a crash site
 Influenced by niggas that spoke the gang culture fluent
 Assuring that some blossom early and some truant
 Thank God for the album I idolized
 It's dark and plus hell is hot, that's the start of this crazy ride
 Two young niggas, me and Dave inside the garage
 And thought we was Jay and Dame
 That's the lane that we tried to drive
 Truthfully, I just started rappin' to get away
 I never thought that your favorite rapper would want a verse
 My nigga got hit 25 times with a K
 Make the decision, ride the beat or ride in a hearse
 Now Punch is my mentor, Top Dawg is the coach
 Jay Rock is my older brother, I was there when he wrote
 His name on his record deal, we had figured the coast
 Would live on a pedestal, once the shit hit the store
 Found ourselves scrambling, tryna figure it out
 Soul told me that the record shop 'bout to go in a drought
 Q ain't got a place to stay and 'bout to sleep on the couch
 We eatin' off each other tray, the dollar menu amount
 Meanwhile the coast going hard at each other
 The younger rappers had wanted some of the OGs' comfort
 But I ain't need it
 I never screamed out ""the New West,"" I didn't believe it
 They brought each other down, I was planning out my achievements
 I need to separate myself to stand out
 I need a better way to take your fans now
 I need to kill you motherfuckers dead
 Three hollow tips aimed at your head
 I'll be damned if the chopper jam now
 And we never asked for no hand out
 In the midst of it all I recall a call when you said how
 We could never resolve in the hall of fame
 And I went to the trial with a Bible and a rifle
 I play the game as I blam blow
 Hollaback at me, nigga
 And if they said that I'm the one, why you asking me, nigga?
 'Cause when the whole world see you as Pac reincarnated
 Enough pressure to make you just open the Book of David
 And pray to God that ya make it or live your life in the matrix
 'Cause falling off is a sickness, I heard that it's quite contagious
 I need to separate myself to stand out
 I need a better way to take your fans now
 I need to kill you motherfuckers dead
 Three hollow tips aimed at your head
 I'll be damned if the chopper jam now
 And we never asked for no hand out
 I'll take you back to that pack of Black & Milds in my hand now
 In the midst of it all was cooking with pots and pans out
 Looking forward as four of us are forced to form a new clan now
 Fast forward as I wait in line for this passport
 The homies was still poor, was working at Jansport
 Whoever thought that Rosenberg would mention me to Dre?
 Even Vanessa from XXL had told him press play
 And there goes my fate, now I'm on stage with Snoop
 Gave me the torch and I ran with it in high pursuit
 Rapped with my forefathers, even wreck it with Gaga too
 Lyricist of the year, fuck am I supposed to do? Rock
 Laughing at you niggas out there who thought we was flukes
 Exaggerated shit that we rapped had came true
 Thought I was aggravated, when Warner had let me loose
 I was honest, see they was haunted when Mike Jones didn't recoup
 Cool, 'cause niggas won't outdo us in the booth
 Even when my album leak, fans still buy it for proof
 I came, I saw, I conquered
 No shame, I blame all of this on Compton
 Thinkin' 'bout when Sherane tried to set me up
 Cold game, full circle, they set up her
 I put my life in these twelve songs, my fight in these twelve songs
 The fight to ignite any wrong or right that I prolong
 The story was short film, the glory of him and them
 The worry of mothers that don't recover when baby's killed
 The trial and the tribulations, the newer Miseducation
 The view of a body wasting, you knew somebody who ain't make it
 The angry, the adolescent, the reason I ask this question
 Will you let hip-hop die on October 22nd?

The Heart Part 4,The Heart Part 4,,1,4:48,,Single,,23 Mar 17,1,"Don't tell a lie on me
 I won’t tell the truth 'bout you
 Don't tell a lie on me
 I won’t tell the truth 'bout you
 Thirty millions later, my future favors
 The legendary status of a hip-hop rhyme savior
 Travel 'round the atlas in this spaceship
 Candy-coated, my day shift's
 Been devoted to fuckin' up bundles of paper
 Pi equals 3-14
 The devil's pie is big enough to justify the whole thing
 Wait up, lampin' in Jamaica
 The clouds turnin', my thoughts turnin’
 Burnin’ castor oil, yo I been determined to make an earnin'
 This seed in this soil is classified
 I’m satisfied when I strategize my kid's future
 I ain't sanctified enough to say that I won't shoot ya
 I done vandalized the industry full circuit
 The earthiest slash thirstiest nigga you know versus this
 Scum of a land that transcend two surfaces
 The richer the poorer, the bigger the picture
 The more blood pours, but—
 Don’t tell a lie on me
 I won't tell the truth 'bout you
 Don't tell a lie on me
 I won't tell the truth 'bout you
 My fans can't wait for me to son ya punk-ass
 And crush ya whole lil' shit
 I'll Big Pun ya punk-ass, you a scared lil' bitch
 Tiptoein' around my name, nigga, you lame
 And when I get at you, homie
 Don't you just tell me you was just playin'
 Oh, I was just playin', K-Dot
 C'mon, you know a nigga rock with you, bro
 Shut the fuck up, you sound like the last nigga I know
 Might end up like the last nigga I know
 Oh, you don't wanna clash? Nigga, I know
 I put my foot on the gas, head on the floor
 Hoppin' out before the vehicle crash, I'm on a roll
 Yellin', ""One, two, three, four, five
 I am the greatest rapper alive""
 So damn great, motherfucker, I've died
 What you hearin' now is a paranormal vibe
 House on the hill, house on the beach, nigga (facts)
 A condo in Compton, I'm still in reach, nigga (facts)
 I'm fresh out the water, I'm 'bout to breach, nigga
 The five-foot giant woke up out of his sleep, nigga
 Oh yeah, oh yeah, mo' cars, mo' lears
 Mo' bars, no peers, no scars, no fear—fuck y'all, sincere
 I heard the whispers, I curved the whispers
 You know what the risk is
 Earthed in ditches, your body revertin' to stiffness
 The whole world gone mad
 Bodies is addin' up, market's about to crash
 Niggas is fake rich, bitches is fake bad
 Blacks that act white, whites that do the dab
 Donald Trump is a chump
 Know how we feel, punk—tell him that God comin'
 And Russia need a replay button, y'all up to somethin'
 Electorial votes look like memorial votes
 But America's truth ain't ignorin' the votes
 It's blasphemy, how many gon' blast for me?
 I prophesized on my last song, you laughed at me
 But when the shit get brackin', don't you ask for me
 How many leaders gon' tell you the truth after me?
 G Malone, big bro, kudos to him
 I was two Os from a M, tryna be big as Em
 Thirty millions later, my future favors
 The legendary status of a hip-hop rhyme savior
 Salmon and capers, fame and lawsuits
 You lookin' at me in Chucks, I'm lookin' at y'all suits
 Me and Top Dawg playin' rock-paper-scissors in court
 A real hustler lose money just to go get some more
 I said it's like that, dropped one classic, came right back
 'Nother classic, right back
 My next album, the whole industry on a ice pack
 With TOC, you see the flames
 In my E-Y-Es—it's not a game
 And the whole world is goin' mad, daddy, it's sad, daddy
 My only advice? Go and get you a bag, daddy
 Lee Baca on trial tryna portray a boxer
 Beatin' up on my niggas while the COs watch him
 Tables turned, lesson learned, my best look
 You jumped sides on me, now you 'bout to meet Westbrook
 Go celebrate with your team and let victory vouch you
 Just know, the next game played I might slap the shit out you
 Technical foul, I'm flagrant, I'm foul
 They throwin' me out, you throw in the towel
 Look at the crowd, they— (Naw, I don't like that)
 Look at my smile, I'm smirkin'
 Calm but urgent (That ain't the style, fuck!)
 So many verses, you live in denial (Fuck!)
 So many verses, I never run out (What?)
 You makin' him nervous, the music is loud
 Ho, JAY-Z Hall of Fame, sit yo punk-ass down!
 (Sit yo punk-ass down)
 So that means you ain't bigger than rapping (What else?)
 So that means no more playin' the back scenes (What else?)
 My spot is solidified if you ask me (What else?)
 My name is identified as ""That King""
 I'll let y'all worry about a list, I'm on some other shit
 A difference between accomplishments and astonishments
 You know what time it is, ante up, this is in forever
 Y'all got 'til April the 7th to get y'all shit together
 Let's get it!
 Look, look!

I Do it for Hip Hop,Black Hippy,,1,5:30,,Mixtape (Black Hippy),1,11 Jan 11,11,"Full time grinder. Watts City rhymer
 The ghetto Moses tryna get my homies outta bondage
 Need some time to think so I'm rolling up the ganja
 Sneaking out my pores, know I'm blowing on the bombest
 Bars looking nice, my rap smoke polish
 A God on the mic, wack rappers pay homage
 Leader of the new school
 Everytime I bust a rhyme, incredible lines
 When I talk, make em' press rewind
 I do it for Hip Hop, fuck what you heard
 Do it for my nigga's who voices will never be heard
 Listen, blessed with talent, voice of the young people
 Went from a zero, now my city label me as a hero
 Nine, double-O, five, nine, that's where the chopper sing
 Sound so melodic, the problems, that's what the drama brings
 Dog I'm gutted as ever strivin' for finer things
 One-O-Five Eastbound, swervin' in and out of lanes
 This game filled with a lot of lames
 On the real my nigga, this shit gotta change
 From Cali to Queens, Top Dawg guarantee
 We the new regime
 I don't do it for them cars and the fancy drops
 I do it for hip hop
 I do it for hip hop
 I do it for hip hop
 And I don't it for the chains and the flashin rocks
 I do it for hip hop
 I do it for hip hop
 I do it for hip hop
 Like, 4 years ago
 I was writing rhymes in my Chevy Celebrity
 Spittin' the hardness, says Doc Elery
 It's prophecy I shine, ask cashanova
 Burnin' up my notepad tryna ash my doja
 Sober...
 For the game you decayed I sow it up
 You must say yes too much
 Cause you don't know enough
 To match my caliber, I'm a whole new breed
 Ya stamina's shot, I'm movin' like the old .23
 For hip hop I breath...
 Have a seat, I'm a beast
 And I'm ready for war with no peace
 Seems that they forgot to rap, you had to think
 They just wanna be ballers when you see em' on the screen
 Who am I to say the grass ain't green
 Who am I to say the next generation don't share the same vision as we
 I will say this, it's less likely
 Than me having clean piss
 Rest in peace
 Omar Jones
 Your spirits in my lyrics when I flow
 Became the number one prospect
 All because I keep it true, I don't do it for the coupe
 I don't do it for them cars and the fancy drops
 I do it for hip hop
 I do it for hip hop
 I do it for hip hop
 And I don't it for the chains and the flashin rocks
 I do it for hip hop
 I do it for hip hop
 I do it for hip hop
 Draped in stone like I gazed at Medusa
 Download my audio and blow up your computers
 Spit that conglomerate shit, the shit that you aren't used to
 Shit so strong the unborn can smell it in the future
 They'll sell it and they’ll shoot ya
 A mom and pop store sold out
 And the fan killed the clerk over my music
 Is that real?
 Realer than me at sixteen, writing 16s, battled and dismantled six teens
 All for the love of hip-hop, I would still rap
 Even if Rodman came back and my diss flopped
 Thats an analogy built with substance
 Fuck an award, my metaphors for the public
 You forging your signature on the great great K-Dot
 I gotta catapult you, bye bye
 I wake up in the morning then compose a bar
 Flow reckless like the first time you driven a car
 Perfected, from years of dedication
 Wrote my first 50 songs and then I graduated
 With my bachelor's
 And if you hearing this verse, I probably got my masters
 And by the end of this verse I'm your favorite rapper
 I don't do it for them cars and the fancy drops
 I do it for hip hop
 I do it for hip hop
 I do it for hip hop
 And I don't it for the chains and the flashin rocks
 I do it for hip hop
 I do it for hip hop
 I do it for hip hop
 Coming from where the diplomas don't matter
 Backpacks still carry the work
 Big burner under the shirt
 Shit I just wanted her purse
 Kill a bitch and hit the studio to murder a verse
 I'm just getting it in
 Reminiscing about the time when I was stressing to rhyme
 Started getting better, shit I'm destined to shine
 Clip load up
 Fuck it back to the crime
 Profession of pro skaters couldn't fuck with my grind
 Still stuck with a nine
 Shooting like MJ in his prime
 You motherfuckers know what it is
 Straight splatter your wig
 Let your mother know its personal
 And murder your kids
 Little nieces buried in anchovies
 Rap Lebron, Kobe
 Hip-hop, shit, no matter what I'm talking
 Cough on the beat and its abortion
 Murder motherfuckers, straight extortion
 Live on the beat
 Who wanna compete?
 Down in Miami spitting heat, straight tragic
 Move to Orlando working magic
 Cocaine balls out the cabinet
 Uncut, raw, whole ransom
 Anybody can get it, I'm fully committed to hip hop",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,https://t2.genius.com/unsafe/857x0/https%3A%2F%2Fimages.genius.com%2F92ed07cac7ed2346acbaaf80783a3466.426x426x1.jpg,,,,,https://www.datpiff.com/Kendrick-Lamar-Black-Hippy-mixtape.188002.html,,,,,https://genius.com/Black-hippy-i-do-it-for-hip-hop-lyrics,330,5.5,0.09,,Yes,19,,,,,,,,,,,1,,,,,,,,,,,,1,,,,,,1,,,,,,,,,,,,,1,,,,,,,,,,,,1,,,,,,,,,,,,X,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1,,,,,,,2,,1,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1,,,,,,,,,,,

 You better study real hard before you end up with an F
 Be my guest, soul's what every soul wants to be I guess
 I'm with the B-I pardon me I be a phenom
 Heard you was a fag in L.A. like FILA
 Whatever happened to the U-N-I-T-Y?
 Like Queen Latifa
 See you steam as a little teapot (how so?)
 Short but not too stout (uh)
 Your clout fabricate what you 'bout (huh)
 I'm bout done fuckin' wit' you small time MC's
 Nigga I'm competin' wit' Pun
 Run up and get done up like a prom hair-do
 Top floor still on the come up, where are you?
 It's one million ways to die I'm livin' proof
 Matter fact let me rephrase that (Try me)
 ""Action speaks louder than words""
 ""Actions—"" ""Action speaks louder than words""
 ""Action speaks louder than words""
 ""Actions—"" ""Action speaks louder than words""
 Committed to my cash, loyal to my projects
 But AR knock off a nigga biceps
 I'm a go getter, I'm a gorilla
 Nigga I'm the shit, shit on shitters I'm realer
 I'm so exquisite, bitches they love to visit
 Fuck'em and send them home with their fucking thongs missing
 I'm what the game missing that why them rappers hatin'
 Next nigga who try me I'ma leave his head vacant (blah)
 Goon to the death, thanks to my habitat
 See before you speak you better watch who you yappin' at
 And if you speak then it's you I'll be clappin' at
 One shot, one kill no clappin' back
 I'm in the streets, I hear you niggas talkin'
 Claimin' they killers and that ain't even in they hearts
 They something like ink on a piece of paper, marks
 I'm something like a razor blade, sharp

 ""Actions—"" ""Action speaks louder than words""
 ""Action speaks louder than words""
 ""Actions—"" ""Action speaks louder than words""
 Wanna compete with this tech-a-nique?
 Big gun, take a seat
 I can blaze for days but me? Rather take a freak
 Touch socks in the suite, big name in the streets
 Top Dawg ENT, GED, TNT
 40 Glock pop shit, bust into the Glock click
 Semi-automatic lips spit when the pin itch
 Tighter than a closed fist
 Product make your nose twitch
 All that bold shit have you buried where my dog piss
 Tortoise speedin' through the game like Porsches
 Fortress, thousand dollar frames on our porches
 Cautious, cock it and explode the track
 Your brain over wax, it's solved over rap
 Shots breathe, got power tell the cops freeze
 Countin' all this bread, Aftermath not Eve
 Big league I'm the best my spot's earned
 You niggas disagree? (try me)

 Anybody can get it
 Send 'em in a cloud if you think sky's the limit
 I'm foul like a elbow intended
 In the game no winning even if it is a scrimmage
 You can get coached right now
 Black Phil Jackson maxin'
 Cooler than George Bush when the planes went down
 As far as rappin'?
 I should be a wordsmith
 Porsche GT swerve like cursive (beep beep)
 Y'all wait on Wayne to drop C3
 I drop C4, bomb on you (I mean war)
 No white flag put 'em in a full body cast
 Like a sitcom, make 'em sit calm, I sip Dom P
 Bumpin' the Iselys with a bitch on

 Need another level been advanced too long
 Niggas want war come on

 Ugh, this nigga tryin' to meet the architect
 You going about this thing the wrong way
 That kinda far fetched (kinda far fetched)
 What's the reason for this nonsense?
 You listen to your boys
 You should have reasoned with your conscience (naw)
 You wasn't built for this content
 I send a chick at you that dabble in bondage
 Tie you to the bed post as you respond with kindness
 Even let her blindfold you, you love how she dominant
 My Spanish chick from Brooklyn, Bed-Stuy
 Who specialize in givin' Brazilian Neckties
 While I sip a Mai Tai
 Cause my time is far more important
 Than to be shootin' it out with tough guys
 (And I) still flow like faucet water
 My niggas half step like foster daughters
 My mic can slaughter a nation like the angel of god
 You think this lyrical homicide nigga?

On Some Other Shit,Black Hippy,,3,3:28,,Mixtape (Black Hippy),1,11 Jan 11,11,"I'm on some other shit

 So what you on my nigga?
 I'm on some other shit
 So what you on my nigga?
 I'm on some other shit
 Ha ha
 Black Hippy
 My mind traveling through different dimensions
 One of the reasons why they tripping off the rhymes that I'm kicking
 Like a Sensai with a black belt, I'm that felt
 Give yo ass some pretty wings
 I handle MACs well
 Arm less sergeant salute me
 Ab-Soul-lutlely
 On some other shit leave the booth full of dookie
 Off the head like a noogie and my life's like a movie
 Play your role while I roll another doobie
 To smoke
 We got 'em high catch another quote
 Look in my eyes, never lie boy I'm on my toes
 Like a Korean with nail polish you niggas know
 Acting like you don't oh fo sho
 Tell 'em Soul!
 Ha ha!
 You know we out your galaxy
 An astrologist couldn't find a better analogy
 Actually we the last of a dying breed
 Living life like its prophecy entirely word up!
 I'm on some other shit
 Yeah, me too?
 I'm on some other shit
 Yeah, me too
 I'm on some other shit
 Yeah, me too?
 I'm on some other shit
 Yeah, me too
 Black Hippy
 That's all I need to get busy
 Turn your music to a Frisbee
 Then make your bitch frisk me (come here bitch)
 You be holding rifles hoping that someone will like you
 Searching for a pill like the late Michael
 That's dead wrong
 Um...Keep my heart strung
 Still fucking hoes like an off drum
 Sound of a kitty cat
 And it's still a rap beat
 How you feel on that
 Well I'll sell our music and make moves in the 50 states
 The irony is I'm in Compton with foreign plates
 Bumping Angel Milk, homie play your part
 I be coming down, you coming up short like an Asian bill
 Um....I think I need to get my shit together
 But whatever still flyer than the weather
 Feeling myself so much
 I'm sharp I need more tunes to sever
 And my polos made of leather cuz
 I'm on some other shit
 Yeah, me too?
 I'm on some other shit
 Yeah, me too
 I'm on some other shit
 Yeah, me too?
 I'm on some other shit
 Yeah, me too
 Black Hippy
 Killing the game oh yes I am
 Bringing the pain as I am
 You're just a sweet potato in the pan
 Top Dawg is the label when it's written on my shoulder
 Top notch on my hand, I'll be such 'till its over
 Say hello to the man in demand would 'ya?
 They say when you hot then the fans will come
 So if I say I'm cold then that's an antonym
 You can't stand it huh?
 Uh, yo yo
 I freak a beat like a nympho when I speak
 And so a syllable is like a sex between the sheet
 And you can buy your vowel if you show 'em the receipt
 To prove that my bars are a hundred grand large
 My futures so bright you can see it in the dark
 With the blindfold on the hindsight of a blind dude
 I'm not cocky I'm just confident fucking raw
 Before I knew what a condom is K.

 Ugh, show me some love, my love
 Last time I checked, you loved my love
 Place nothing above my love
 If you leave, come back, like above your butt
 No ifs, ands, or buts
 You're sufficient, but I still wanna fill you up
 When loves runs high (Ha!)
 Just when you thought enough was enough
 I'm a kid in a museum and I just wanna touch
 Every part of your body, tie you up and get naughty
 Ho, we up in this party, HiiiPoWeR, money showers
 All the ladies wanna kick it with Mr. Miyagi
 Pull up, pull up, bring it back, come, rewind (Hey!)
 I wanna touch up and down your spine (Hey!)
 When loves runs high
 Hmm, a perfect 10 living on Cloud 9
 I like to drink all the time, fuck all the time
 Anything that can get me out of my mind
 I'm a rolling stone that needs another home, especially
 When loves runs high
 Now, everybody in the place!
 Toke, toke, toke, toke, toke, toke, toke, toke
 Do it 'til you can't feel your face!

 Ugh, faded off life
 See the dopeman, time to get right
 Open up a Bud Light
 Don Julio, Coronas, comas
 Bad bitches, bad bitches
 Call up bad bitches, bring your friend to be a witness, ugh!
 When loves runs high
 TCH... Whatever that mean
 Ugh, need a shot, you the vaccine
 You pumping through my veins, I'm a crack fiend
 Ugh, you're the crack, ugh
 Drive your ass all night, meet the chauffeur
 Bend you over in a rover, it's over
 Never sober, my cup runneth over
 When loves runs high
 Better know, girl, you fucking with a soldier
 I like to drink all the time, fuck all the time
 Anything that can get me out of my mind
 I'm a rolling stone that needs another home, especially
 When loves runs high

 Blunts and broads
 Drinking on liquor that's hard, oh my God
 Baby tryna grab my drawers
 They call me ""Dozer,"" I knock down walls
 José, that's my homie
 Yeah, I hear you calling Earl in the hallway
 When loves runs high
 I gotta come down just to party
 I'm turnt up, maxed out
 Willie Manchester, blow your back out
 Baby girl, my advice—better back out
 Got that dope stick, I'm the crack house
 Listen, ma, I got a role you can act out
 And then, like Prince pants, get your ass out
 I don't need a princess, I need a mistress
 Who's sticking dick in a damsel in distress
 I like to drink all the time (Soul!), fuck all the time

Shadow of Death,Black Hippy,,5,3:39,,Mixtape (Black Hippy),1,11 Jan 11,11,"Yeah, Los Angeles, ""Welcome to the Terrordome""
 City of Satan, angels can't even get along
 No lie, my town covered in darkness
 Hoping that the sun just shine on us
 Rolling up the kush, now I'm letting my mind wander
 Into another place, I ain't tryna go down under
 Life is like a race and we all tryna finish it
 Shit never fair, strays hitting the innocent
 The good die young where I'm from and it's sad to say
 That somebody gotta die today
 Tomorrow's never promised, but we living for the moment
 Nigga, time never stops, it just keeps on going
 Crackers just gave my young nigga four life sentences
 Twenty-five times four, nigga, do the math
 And the hood never have witnesses
 Cause if we did, then them shots gon' blast
 As I reflect, I start realizing I wanna
 Make a way one day for me and my momma, family and friends
 This ain't the way my life bout to end
 So I'm quick to grab on my pen and
 Give 'em something my people sure to feel
 Give 'em something that I know is all the way real
 Just wakin' up, mind playing tricks on me
 Got the fifth on me, gotta take a risk homie
 Was a ball player till the coach pissed on me
 Keep it real, I could take you down the list homie
 Be a tradition, see these Chucks be a mission
 Burner be the fuel to the flame, the key to the ignition
 If you banging, be serious, boys run up in your pad
 Point-blank, period, moms ain't hearing it
 Niggas said 'cuz lil nigga got blasted
 Oh well, give a shit, shouldn't half-assed it
 Only time you with it, when your niggas all tripping
 Caught your ass slipping, now I'm stepping up my crip and steady dipping
 Riding through the city in lights, living it trife
 Wrong intersection, ready to fight
 Hopping out with my own agenda, who the contender?
 Better hope this motherfucker jam (Blah!)
 As I reflect, I start realizing I wanna
 Make a way one day for me and my momma, family and friends
 This ain't the way my life bout to end
 So I'm quick to grab on my pen and
 Give 'em something my people sure to feel
 Give 'em something that I know is all the way real
 Uh, as I'm hearing the first and second verse
 I try to analyse the feeling that's felt in the song
 I want to tell Rock and Q to go to church
 But that's a hypocrite because I ain't been in so long
 I stare at the world from a righteous point of view
 And realize a crisis coming
 Novocain couldn't numb it, the pain is unbearable times two
 Let's rally a team, summon, and school the youth
 How you feel about it?
 Man, I feel the same way as you
 It hurts my soul, like a needle piercing
 Through the bottom of my shoe and if you behind bars
 Hold your head, pause
 And if you in close range with a nigga with a gun in his waist
 I pray the intervention is divine
 I got a cousin in jail and handful of homies in heaven
 But earlier than expected, what the hell?
 As I reflect, I start realizing I wanna
 Make a way one day for me and my momma, family and friends
 This ain't the way my life bout to end
 So I'm quick to grab on my pen and
 Give 'em something my people sure to feel
 Give 'em something that I know is all the way real",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,https://t2.genius.com/unsafe/857x0/https%3A%2F%2Fimages.genius.com%2F92ed07cac7ed2346acbaaf80783a3466.426x426x1.jpg,,,,,https://www.datpiff.com/Kendrick-Lamar-Black-Hippy-mixtape.188002.html,,,,,,219,3.65,0.06,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,8,,,,,,,1,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,X,,,,2,,,,,1,1,1,,,,,,,,1,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1,,,,
TDE Roll Call,Black Hippy,,6,4:10,,Mixtape (Black Hippy),1,11 Jan 11,11,"West coast tsunami come jump inside of a wave pool
 Fresh out the county with beepers over their ankles
 Bitches and bugs their earlobes flooded with bengals
 38 slug passenger seat let it bang you
 I was born the same year you was rocking a kangol
 20 years later my style favor a kangaroo
 Jumping off the ground im tapping the star spangle
 Banner with manners over ignorant lost angels
 Cameras flash nappy hippy from every angle
 Hammers will blast snap and hit you from every angle
 Like a porno no homo you wear rainbow
 I'm with a bad chick that can suck on my mandingo
 Your making publicity stunts to make your name blow
 Im dropping c4 every month to make my name blow
 Drive a hoopty every month like its a range rove
 Get in on the passenger side because the door broke
 Take you on a natural high this is for sure dope
 Watch you go be outside then give you more dope
 Im gonna flood the streets outside go buy a raincoat
 Open the door my tapes fall out your Durango
 West coast till im gone and wearing a halo
 Til then im ready for war lets play halo
 Take down the fifth of Hennessy and watch the day go
 Bye like farewell can somebody just pray for
 Me like holiest priest on gods payroll
 Tabernacle to all the Church's Chickens I ate on
 Its K-Dot you motherfucker motherfucker mother blucka blucka bring a ruckus better duck em make you suffer quick suck a dick
 Look, coming from gangbangers and palm trees
 Eating on polly seed and bomb weed
 In Wallabees, better yet, my Wallacees throwin' up the set while I'm chillin in the summer breeze
 You niggas really want the gun to squeeze
 And im shootin from nutting
 Backseat with the window down ready for ducking
 I ain't riding shotgun unless I gotta shotgun fuck around and pop one leave your fuckin' top done
 Like the body shop on a mardi gras
 Bad little bitch keep the gat in the party bra
 You know I'm ready to shoot you know I recruit give me the loot like Big Poppa who shot ya noodle niggas over cheese make pasta
 Top dawg sit at the table we all mobster
 Never passed english and grammar still proper
 My niggas we all gotcha
 My niggas is all shottas
 And niggas ain't nothing but bitches they all gossip
 My words come hard like a bishop in tranquilizer
 And murder goes hand and hand like sanitizers
 I been a problem shootout to Problem
 My gun blow then I get low
 Like a stripper my nigga no homo
 Take a puff of the swisher then get dozed
 I do this for my niggas who is locked up in the prisons that can't get out of them systems there's no hope
 So my mentality gotta be cut throat
 Everytime that I spit it I provoke
 Jay Rock for president go vote
 Put them in a state of shock like a million votes
 I'd go big before I would go broke
 I got bundles of snow so come snope
 Big bottles of henny who wanna toast
 Big bags of green who wanna smoke
 Its on me im a do it for the coast
 Rock city my city till I'm gone
 I'm a make it I can feel it in my bones
 Yeah, I came in with the same precision as Pablo
 Your visions is at hoes, whips and diablos
 City on my shoulder like a poncho
 And I treat the booth like el baño
 Get a whiff of that
 And when its show time i'll take you to the Cinemax
 Los Angeles on the fitted cap
 Committed like Richard Pryor and getting stacks
 Yo Punch they think that history is a joke read up on how they brought Woodstock to watch for black folks
 California souls, you say the west ain't unified like the LA school district you must've missed it
 Riding around my old junior high high, remaniscing I have the same goals now
 But I never thought for a second I needed Snoop and Dre to help me out
 No debit give me all of the credit

 We don't give a fuck
 Hell nah, nigga
 This conglomerate so cool, Rock, we could freeze L.A., nigga
 Black Hippy
 Move in
 Kendrick Lamar
 I tell 'em like this
 Ring the alarm or wake to a bomb
 You ain't a rapper, you Elton John, holding your john
 I got a ton of croutons in the Louis Vuitton
 That's big bread, the chickens are flying, flocks when I come
 Paul and Masson, half-drunk, stuck in a poem
 Light matches underwater while I'm bracing the storm
 I'm cool and I'm calm, laid-back, smoking a farm
 Socking the shit out of niggas 'til I'm breaking my arm
 Up in my zone, two blunts, cup of Patrón
 .45 on me, shoot you if you fuck with me wrong
 No homo, pause, that's your life and it's going flatline
 If you don't put your life in the song
 I never drove a fast car, I almost ran over Tracy Chapman
 She said, ""Drive slow""; I said, ""Fuck off""
 Ab-Soul—what's up, y'all? Other than you're subpar
 Above all? I'm a Heaven gate—above all, fucking great
 And every time we in the stu'
 We cook that, chop that, what's that? That's crack
 Yeah, homie, this is what we do
 3-1-0 shit, 3-2-3, bitch
 Oww, nigga, welcome to the zoo, where we...
 Cook that, chop that, what's that, that's crack
 Yeah, homie, this is what we do
 3-2-3 shit, 3-1-0, bitch!
 The Black Hippys, the bag full, the bag empty
 Spent it all at the car lot, then crash quickly
 I'm trying to come with enough power to pass fifty
 I'm talking fifty bills—you niggas don't fit the bill
 You niggas don't keep it real, you fake as Pamela's titties
 I pound kitties, then hit the club with dogs with me
 Tan Polos, no socks, chopped Dickies
 Tan coupe, no top, bumping Biggie
 Blowing sticky, before the group, been a hippy
 Nifty-fifty, all blue, real Crippy
 Big money, long stocks, ask Pippy
 Mask on, one sock, I gets busy
 I smoke Blacks, relax, and watch Walt Disney
 Puff squares, pace in circles until I'm dizzy
 Speaking of Disney, fantasies, I had many
 I used to hate on Mickey Mouse 'cause he had Minnie
 Anyway, every time we in the stu'
 We cook that, chop that, what's that? That's crack
 Yeah, homie, this is what we do
 3-1-0 shit, 3-2-3, bitch
 Oww, nigga, welcome to the zoo, where we...
 Cook that, chop that, what's that? That's crack
 Yeah, homie, this is what we do
 3-2-3 shit, 3-1-0, bitch!
 Ahhh, napped through my final, made enough, richer than Lionel
 Fucking bitches on my job, coming harder than rhino
 Breaking their spinal, laid-back, bumping my vinyl
 Navigation on the scopes, easy to find 'em...
 ... Find you and I'm right behind you, laid back, puffing a blunt
 Gat on my lap, constantly talking shit; I'ma dump
 Your homies acting charged up, they can still get jumped
 Take your chain, ash the kush for all you punks...
 ... However you want, whenever you want, you all can get it
 Contagious, it's mad syphilis, blazing, it's God-giftedness
 Die over death sentences, flow hot, plus, the beat knock
 Like Jay witnesses, tell 'em I killed the witnesses...
 ... Gifted as 20 Christmases, itching to blow
 Like 20 bitches with mouths that need a dick in it, wow
 I ran rap for half a mile, then got tired
 Laid down and realized that I was lying (You fucking crazy, man!)
 And every time we in the stu'
 We cook that, chop that, what's that? That's crack
 Yeah, homie, this is what we do
 3-1-0 shit, 3-2-3, bitch

 Hollow tips leave your eyes blurry

 I'm on the block gettin' money, blood, man fuck the ones
 I don't talk snitch niggas, I don't fuck with them
 I let the chopper get at ‘em like blum-blum-blum-blum
 Yeah, never trust no bitch, let 'em
 Suck the dick, that's it, then split now it's
 Back to my gutter tip, 24's on the whip
 Montana in the pot, I'm the chef on the shift
 Niggas yappin' at they lip, 'til my gat at they lip

 Or a catcher need a mitt, or a sneaker need a grip
 A gymnast need a flip, or super head need lifts
 Soul-o, yeah I'm comin' straight for the top
 Been spendin' it like a Jew, Happy Hannukah to you
 (Hey you) Huh? Oh shit, can I kick it?
 Dragon breathe fire when I spits it
 Santa Claus raps got me gifted, lifted
 Runnin' at the mouth, get it shifted
 Blistered, thought it was a dream so I pinched it
 Rap got me hooked, so I fished it
 Only 6 bars and I sensed it
 Rise from defeat, never ran from the beef
 Ball hard in the street, Mad Cow with my teeth
 Money over bitches, friends over bitches
 Hoes over bitches, Benz over switches
 Top 5 alive, and you niggas ain't listed
 Hip hop is dead and you know the boy fixed it
 Straight locksmithed it
 Open up the doors for the young nigga sellin' crack
 On the side of stores just to keep the body breathin'
 Never wanna be a heathen
 Been puttin' in the hours
 Shouda blown with the towers
 I'm real talk
 And a nigga was built with a steel heart
 K-Dot on the beat, everybody said they smell fart
 Shit on anybody, I'm a rappin' porta potty
 And I probaby gotta dump right now
 See my hobby is to murder every rapper on the planet
 Make 'em leave the studio in ambulances
 With a bandage on their cranium
 I'm bangin' them on sight, with the bars of titanium
 Brass knuckles, I beat niggas down, who wanna scuffle?
 I’m rude like sayin' ‘fuck you’ to your mother for no reason, now that's cold thinkin'
 What am I drinkin'?
 I do, spiteful shit, shit like fuck your bitch
 Record it, then mail it to your residence
 Say hello to the unforgiving flow, cold with it
 Grab a coke we gon' be here for a minute

 When I grip the pen, that's how it is when I'm on the mic
 I'm the People's Choice
 The streets never lie
 I paid dues so I'm self made
 And if you got something shitty to say
 You get slept or slayed
 Haters in the shade
 They running they mouth
 They steady talking till the gun in they mouth
 Go ahead and chit chat
 That's when you hear the click-clack then its all over
 Too late to bleed, squeeze then flee
 Bleed the streets, bleed the beats
 True story
 I'm straight gutter, all guts
 No glory
 You niggas whack with them same raps
 Y'all bore me
 You're all killers and dealers
 With scrilla like Kobe
 Cut it out, you rappers papier-mache
 K. Lamar my nigga, go ahead and take 'em away
 I said we don't wanna hear that weak shit no more
 My flow China white
 Like a sheep in the snow
 I go deep as the Bible, I could debate with the pope
 And you rappers go down hill
 Like a ski on the slope
 I been a boat with Papi
 But I ain't trying to cop no work
 I'm trying to cop me the boat and some more property
 I told Rock
 ""We gotta be more then just a commodity
 Make the whole name and entity to infinity""
 Y'all want me off the juice, no grenadine
 Could stop me from thinking presidential like the scattered brains of Kennedy
 After I shot, duck down
 So the crowd won't witness me
 Now, could somebody locate Mr. Shakur?
 And tell these Tupacs, they two shots, away from two blocks
 Of being neighbors with the Almighty Lord
 I put your best material in, then fast forward
 Kendrick, signing off
 I'm sure your signature's forged, boy
 They say I'm headed to the county and they said it's for a murder
 In a zone like a touchdown
 No need to be turned down
 Catch a fade, mandatory
 Walk up in the dorm room just me and my heart
 Let it start
 Where you from?
 I bang back
 Start pushing back the rack
 So I guess it's time to scrap
 Run that, Look
 I Whooped his ass for an hour
 Made his nigga have to drag him in the shower
 Survival techniques from the streets don't apply in here
 Just barbarious niggas who'll try your fears, ruthless
 Little church choir and Hell's fire
 And lemme see you sing your ass out of this one
 Smashed out a victim
 Should've kept push ups in your routine
 Eating tuna for your protein
 Most niggas turn scary, fags get buried
 Snatch a mothafucka's commissary
 Dont worry I'm a gangster
 Look
 First name Herbert
 Last name Steven
 Don't call it my government
 Cause I don't know none of them
 As far as rap
 I'm running it like I'm getting robbed
 Target wasn't quite my target
 That's why I quit my job
 These niggas better hop on board
 When my ship sets sail and I sell a few records
 Sipping Guinness and set a few records
 Enough is never enough
 I gotta do extra
 I gotta go the distance
 I gotta prosper, I gotta put my mamacita
 In that big casa
 I gotta be the
 Realest if not the illest to spit a verse
 God MC, Pick a church
 Hallelujah
 Don't let the curly hair fool you
 My hair ain't quite wool
 And my feet ain't bronze
 And it's inadequate thinking I used to run Nazareth
 Imagine if this hoodie was a crown of thorns
 You wish you had the stamina to go that hard
 Get your punchlines up, then maybe we could spar
 Your lyrics should make a point, then maybe we could score
 Then maybe I could show you how three met-a-four
 (Beat runs out)
 Metaphorically speaking I'm more indecent
 Then papa bear getting distracted enjoying his porridge, peep it
 In a war, I rip a warrior to pieces
 Make a Domino effect, like I'm delivering pizzas
 (Kendrick:""Let him go, let him keep going"")
 And if that ain't a fact, then neither is Jesus
 Black-lipped bastard
 Puffing on a pasture
 I hit a chick till she holla' like she caught the Holy Ghost
 Then I passed her, holy smokes
 I bring disaster to every quote
 You a Shasta to a Coke
 I'm a master
 Sensei with a pen raised
 Build up bricks, just to break
 In the dojo blowing do-do
 And to be frank
 I'm so hot I make the snow flake
 On any day

 Reach goals better than David Beckham, out of control
 Kick it to my shoe, glued to your rectum, your asshole
 Californ-I-A, 'tiI disintegrate interstate 105
 We ride, you imitate
 We eliminate anybody that penetrate any kind of negative vibe
 Temperature rise
 Southern Cali sun, shades over eyes
 Never wear suits, but keep corporate ties
 Like I do (Who are you?)
 Soul brother, number deuce, Lil Petrusse
 I be over the edge like Q in Juice
 Through and through, back to back hits like profile views
 Or fiends strung out, keep watchin'
 I bring the heat to your closet, make your team run out
 Honest, I gets down and I look at the chronic and say
 Lift me up, lift me up, lift me up, lift me up
 Lift me up, lift me up, lift me up, lift me up
 Lift me up, lift me up, lift me up, lift me up
 Lift me up, lift me up, lift me up, lift me up
 I'm in the 745 and I call it the Black Knight
 My music get you high, remind me of crack pipes
 Flip ya boy up, before they stitch ya boy up
 And we stump ya homie out, they won't pick ya boy up
 I ain't playin' with 'em, I'll choke you dummy

 The ghetto, ghetto, g-ghetto
 Oh, haha, oh!
 Oh, haha, oh!
 Still riding through the ghetto with the metal right on side of me
 Kill a California nigga, palm trees and poverty
 East side, wild city; got my block with me
 Bags of that kush, big bottles, sip a lot of Henny
 In the ghetto with my goons and my real bitches
 Nothing but a B thang, show you where we bang (Nickerson!)
 Hurry on the grind, getting Benjamins
 Yeah, we either selling a pill or meds for dividends
 Keep heaters for the evil trying to greet us
 Death around the corner, you don't want to meet the reaper
 All we know is Blood money, we ain't never had a visa
 Trying to wade in that reefer, only thing that could feed us
 Had the ghetto with my Bloods since the days of a fetus
 Raised by the streets, so it's nothing you can teach us
 Bring the word like a preacher
 Jay Rock a.k.a bring the real to the people
 In the ghetto, ghetto, g-ghetto
 G-ghetto, ghetto, g-ghetto
 I comes from the bottom but now I'm on top
 Ain't no one stop me yo
 I comes from the ghetto, ghetto, g-ghetto
 Where all of my niggas, where all of my niggas
 And all of my niggas will roll up in the spot
 And get ghetto, ghetto, g-ghetto
 They say the boy abeast on the mic like whoa
 When the homies show him love? Like, everywhere he go
 Black rag up the back pocket, different than the 'fo
 West coast until I'm gone, I'm here to let you niggas know
 Eastwood in this motherfucker, swanging like I wanna
 Even if I have to push a couple rocks on the corner
 I posted on the corner, blowing that marijuana
 With a loaded .45, for haters that really want it
 Not just because I don't really carry contraband and guns
 Living that thug life, cause only homies show me love
 What you expect from us? All we know is the hood and drugs
 It was the debt on us, that's why they keep us in the slums
 But I was built for more and can't let the ghetto can't stop me
 Why go to war, when they shoot me here like paparazzi
 I gotta make it out cause nobody else will
 And momma love to see me up in XXL (Oh cool!)
 You niggas know wHo it is, and it's easy to see (yeaH)
 Number-one emcee, it ain't easy to be (naH)
 Twin Glock ain't sHow wHen I'm speaking the flows
 Get snobbisH on a bitcH, I ain't speaking to Hoes (bitcH!)
 Still grinding every day, stay puffing a blunt
 Cops are robbing (hell no!), we play Crips and Bloods
 Make it rain on the streets, still make it flood
 (ScHoolboy Q!) Yeah, roll out the rug
 Ab-Soul, what you gonna tell me
 I ain't trying to see the grave, I'm just want to get paid
 In full, like Ace, 'til my momma's straight
 And if I go to jail, tell momma I'm straight
 Cause I, chose this life, and now I lead it
 Got too rich - got two cents? Keep it
 Cause you might need it, more than I
 All My Life Remix, brought to you by:
 In the ghetto, ghetto, g-ghetto
 G-ghetto, ghetto, g-ghetto
 I comes from the bottom but now I'm on top

 I comes from the ghetto, ghetto, g-ghetto
 Where all of my niggas, where all of my niggas
 And all of my niggas will roll up in the spot
 And get ghetto, ghetto, g-ghetto
 This what you doing for town, huh Rock
 Watts that's what it do, Watts stand up
 All my life, yeah I've been waiting for this
 No Rocka-fella had me pissed off
 But Mack and Stunna Man make the pain get lost
 Now I'm popping on the charge, like a tube of lip gloss
 Breaking old niggas off, like I'm hella Rick Ross
 Scream ""New West"" had everybody pounding
 Like I give a fuck, tell them do something about it
 Waited my turn, yeah feel my buzz
 Now it's me and Jay Rock, and all eyes on us, uh
 I, I, I know you coppers expect me to fail
 Oh well, I'm living life on the executive scale
 You want to do me like Sean Bell, never spend a second in jail
 Go to hell, I got records to sell
 Me and Jay Rock getting this cheese
 You can ask my homie Adolf, he repped them niggas and G's
 I'm in Long Beach, feeling the breeze
 Nobody graduated on my block, it's still is a million degrees
 I came in this game with a dollar and a dream
 Posted on a block, blue collar wasn't me
 My momma put me out, and I would step up in the streets
 But I ain't mad at her, cause it made me a beast
 I come from the era of the ""Fuck The Police!""
 Where tinies pick you up and drop you off down the street
 And say I'm too street and pay bitches on these beats
 But they all ever seem to hear is RSC
 Vamos, todo mi vida en el barrio no supe mas
 Long Beach California, the cinos de Watts
 Mira como abrazo el bloke a yo
 Y ahora mira lo que toque, yo
 No más pistolas y rosas, no
 No más mi con fácil copas, no
 Aprendí si no hay pratsa nadie avanza
 El barrio nos hypnoto chansas y los planchas
 Amor a las calles, que me criaron a mi
 A ese que murió porque me brincaron a mi
 Fuiste lo mas real desde que te conocí
 Mucha sangre, mucha lágrimas yo lo vi
 El esfuerzo tatuado en mi cuerpo
 El mejor secreto guardado por cierto
 Descanso con un ojo despierto
 Silencio soy el águila del siento
 I used to Christmas shop in the dollar store
 And let a boy spend guap at the Prada store
 I gotta, thank God for my rhyming though
 Beause everyone in the hood trying to blow
 And I ain't trying to say I got it honest though, cause
 I was right there at that corner store
 I had it all - from the pills to the pot to blow
 I even had cream, like Rocky Road
 I thought getting out the hood was impossible
 That's all I know, I ain't that responsible
 So I'ma stay right here, where it's logical
 And I can buy this twenty-fives in popsicles
 All of a sudden, this rap got popping though
 Heard he rap, but he look so rock-n-roll
 Call me ya boy, who better? Cause I got the note
 If you ain't talking money, then I got to go. Bye!
 Pass to the streets, I done mastered rap
 Got the black bandana with the strap to match
 Got the blue bandana with the Chucks to go
 As I rock throwback like the Huxtables
 Man, Carson too rich, you can head to the pack
 We made a name down there, and they'll vouch for that
 You can go ask Jeezy, or go and ask Puff
 Go and ask Kan, I grind for mine
 I got a sick swagger, short as a dagger knife
 I'ma send us to the beach, just for bragging rights
 My whip lean, my shoes clean
 Diamond watch, low-key, off set, mint green
 Doing my thing, in the fast lane man
 I'm Terry Wayne Kennedy, you niggas not gon front at me
 I've been trying to be telling you niggas that be killing me
 You need to stop it
 (You got it back, huh?) Guess who's now in the game?
 I got a new deal, so I bought me a chain
 I know it weren't smart but fuck it it's gone
 Marshmallow-sized rocks, got the luckiest charm
 Pitching for the top, like I've stuck in the office
 Look like new waves but I'm stuck in my house
 Niggas want to creep when they think that you on
 So the heat stay around me like I'm stuck in a stove, my Lord!
 In the ghetto, ghetto, g-ghetto
 G-ghetto, ghetto, g-ghetto
 I comes from the bottom but now I'm on top
 Ain't no one stop me yo
 I comes from the ghetto, ghetto, g-ghetto
 Where all of my niggas, where all of my niggas
 And all of my niggas will roll up in the spot
 And get ghetto, ghetto, g-ghetto
 (I feel you Jay)
 I came from a single-parent home, mom did all the dirty work
 Only good day is when we could hear the birdies chirp
 And even though I moved a little work
 I still suited up for a Sunday at church
 Then back to the block, to diss a few packs
 Damn, it felt good to count a few stacks
 This day and night though, I know it ain't right
 But down in the hood, man, this is our life
 I won't lie on y'all
 My only concern, is y'all don't lie on me
 My speech slurred, cause I'm buzzin'
 Jay Rock, they hatin' cause I'm buzzin', cousin
 And the blue rag kicking it harder
 But that red shit is thicker than water
 Both feet pivot hard on the angle
 Hood on the pack on, stars on the ankle
 In the ghetto, ghetto, g-ghetto
 G-ghetto, ghetto, g-ghetto
 I comes from the bottom but now I'm on top
 Ain't no one stop me yo
 I comes from the ghetto, ghetto, g-ghetto
 Where all of my niggas, where all of my niggas
 And all of my niggas will roll up in the spot
 And get ghetto, ghetto, g-ghetto
 Product of the block, young rider from the block
 Used to run on 'em niggas, spot and rob them with the Glock
 In the hood we the mind workers, hood like a job
 Got my enemies hot, cause I made a good buck
 We from ashy to classy, no jewels to flashing
 Hundred thousand dollars but still wearing khakis
 I'm a, I'm a hustler, I get it from my daddy
 I heard the ones want me, they gon' have to come and catch it
 Yeah, yeah
 I'm at the top now, haters give me props now
 (Props now) From the Fronts to the George Downs
 I'm on fire, that means that I'm high man
 I'm so cocky, you wish you could be Bang
 You can't stop me, I live like the gutter lane
 Banging Lu so tight, like a bike chain
 You done fucked up, yelling by the poolside
 Yeah, I ride these socks, Adidas
 In the ghetto, ghetto, g-ghetto
 G-ghetto, ghetto, g-ghetto
 I comes from the bottom but now I'm on top
 Ain't no one stop me yo
 I comes from the ghetto, ghetto, g-ghetto
 Where all of my niggas, where all of my niggas
 And all of my niggas will roll up in the spot
 And get ghetto, ghetto, g-ghetto
 Listen to the pain of a real crack baby
 My daddy died, now he ain't coming back baby
 Momma be stressing, I told her I was blessed
 So worried for Christmas, she bought me a present
 My brother snort coke, my sister on dope
 My little nigga's driving, they tired of being broke
 In and out of jail, I'm living in hell!
 Little girl got raped, and she ain't even yell!
 I came from nothing, rose from the slums
 Now your boy Roscoe doing shows out in London
 Ain't that something? Your boy been hustling
 End of the day, can't say nothing from 'em
 God damn, I'm a good ass rapper
 Half these wack rappers is some good ass actors
 Seen them on TV, and be like that's gangsta
 But in real life, they ain't shit - they can't spit
 In the ghetto, ghetto, g-ghetto
 G-ghetto, ghetto, g-ghetto
 I comes from the bottom but now I'm on top
 Ain't no one stop me yo
 I comes from the ghetto, ghetto, g-ghetto
 Where all of my niggas, where all of my niggas
 And all of my niggas will roll up in the spot

 So what’s the, what’s the, what’s the scenario
 Here we go yo, here we go yo
 So what’s the, what’s the, what’s the scenario
 Crept up in this muthafucka soundin like a stun gun
 Fresh up out the hotbox got me smellin' like marijuana
 Flyer than a Desert Eagle when it’s starin’ down lookin’ at my people
 Shootin muthafuckas down just because I’m evil
 Live and direct like Cable TV pay-per view pay me
 Who Q? Ha-chu yeah blessed it, beautifulest tune
 You’ll tune on the record
 Everything is coke so I kick like Liu Kang
 Thinkin you can really get with this man you playin
 Get you a platoon, yeah floatin’ like balloons
 Get so high got to space then I shitted on the moon
 Went into a rage now the sun won’t shade Mars
 Know I got bars so I’m aimin for the stars
 Everyone applaud, praise to the genius
 Never would like to let the hoes bow to the penis
 Feenish
 Kendrick relentless in other words a dentist
 I’m in they mouth without a doubt
 It’s funky grab an incent
 Grab a honkey, grab a nigga, grab a wetback, grab a chink
 Then put ‘em in a box like Michael and Leon Spinks
 Then tell me what you get for cultures feeling me
 As if they was blind and braille on my sleeve
 Peace, to hip-hop, down to earth
 Word to the voice of Chris Rock
 Can I rock like a '88 Camaro and T-Top
 Whoa, the scenario seem to flip like an aerial
 As I dip like a pull-up bar at the gym
 Won’t you witness the gem
 I’m a troop from Angola and
 You a cop on patrol that’s trying to Axel Foley
 As dumb as Napoleon Dynamite and I’m quick to blow up then boom
 Combustible like flames and petroleum
 It’s Jay Rock
 Niggas know my status
 Flip flows like a gymnast on a apparatus
 Leave yo body in pain if I hit you with this ‘matic
 Don’t even speak if you ain’t talkin cabbage
 Loyal to the cash, thinkin’ ‘bout a marriage
 Committed to the block that’s somethin’ niggas cherish
 Hmm.. if you dissin’, you missing Parish
 Then I’m on a mission, fishin Paris
 Lookin’ at some dimes, go get your cameras
 Black Hippy emcees and we got hammers
 Gang member slash rap nigga
 The name’s Rock, all the hoes call me that nigga
 Never relax, never do that
 Soon as you relax, them lames is stealin’ ya swag
 I’m the truth in the booth I’m killin’ the track
 To the point of no return no bringin’ It back
 I’m so fluent on the beat just spittin’ the facts
 You lames lyin, think you chief
 You bridgin’ the gap
 I’m the fountain of youth, you niggas is tap
 Like bugs in the phone, you niggas is wack
 Enter the mind of the utmost divine
 Heel up reel up, bring it back come rewind
 Twilight zone, war with the star
 Hans Soulo
 Top Dawg, not Todo, notch logo
 On my hand, knock you out
 Goddamn!
 Say I’m not lethal, inhumane
 Squeeze juice out a beetle
 Offended John Lennon come to cloud 9
 That’s where the cockpit is
 Me and Kendrick Lamar startling all contenders
 ScHoolboy Q, gangsta with a USC student IQ
 And Jay Rock a fuckin’ fool
 You make the wrong fuckin move
 He like “Don't fuckin' move!”
 Aimin’ at you with the tool
 I’m like what am I to do?
 Crazy how the shit we make come out phenomenal
 Black Hippy, and as for me I’m the black sheep passin’ weed

 Tu quieres coger mis huevos, y papi me molestes
 Pero chuparse puto pendejo, el pinche cabron
 Let's get it – nights like this, I'm a knight like this
 Sword in my hand, I fight like this
 And I'm more than a man, I'm a god
 Bitch, touché, en garde
 Toupée drop and her two tits pop
 Out of that tank top and bra
 And when I say ""Doo-doo, doo-doo,"" bitch, that be K. Dot
 She want some more of this
 I give her more of this, I owe her this
 In fact, I know she miss the way I floored this, on forgis
 I know my Houston partners, drop a four on this
 And focus, and slow it down
 Alright, let me blow this bitch
 I'm famous, I blame this on you, cash in the mirror
 Hang in my penthouse roof, skyline the clearest
 Watch it, your optics poppin' out, you look the weirdest
 Pop my top on the 105, head with no power steerin', ah!
 Oh, oh, luxury
 Chidi-ching-ching, could buy anything, cop that
 Oh, oh, collard greens
 Three degrees low, make it hot for me, drop that
 Bummy nigga famous, straight from the bottom
 Broke niggas hate it, still never robbed him
 Guns in the basement, out they have a problem
 Kush be my fragrance, we love marijuana
 Function on fire, burn the roof off this mothafucka
 Psych ward is ballin', go craze like no other
 Weed steady blowin', pass the blunt to my momma
 Runs in the family, puff-puff keep a nigga fiendin'
 Faded, faded, faded, right?
 Shot glass super size, she gon' get some dick tonight
 Meet me at the W, and no, it's not the Westside
 Stick it up your Southside (icky-icky, icky-icky)
 Baller futuristic, groovy gangsta with an attitude
 What these niggas make a year
 I spend that on my daughter shoes
 Smokin' weed and drinkin', all the college students lovin' Q
 We gon' turn it out until the neighbors wanna party too
 Oh, oh, luxury
 Chidi-ching-ching, could buy anything, cop that
 Oh, oh, collard greens
 Three degrees low, make it hot for me, drop that
 Oh, oh, oh, down with that shit
 Drink this, smoke this, get down with the shit
 Hey, oh, oh, down with the shit
 Drink this, smoke this, down with the shit",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,https://i1.sndcdn.com/artworks-sZ3YH02HkgOs-0-original.jpg,,,,https://soundcloud.com/blackhippyofficial/sets/two,,,,,,,255,4.25,0.07,,Yes,1,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1,,,,,,,,,,,,,2,,,,,,,1,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1,,,,,,,1,,2,,,,,,,,1,,,,,,,,,,1,,,,,1,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Black Friday,Two,,4,3:55,,Mixtape (Black Hippy),2,22 Apr 20,14,"Dick hard like rottweiler
 Can you handle it? Can you handle it? Woo woo, woo woo
 The whole industry been in shambles
 Everybody fugazi, I’m just changing the channel
 Kendrick Lamar, the people’s champion, I'm animal for analysts
 Career damaging verses, meditating with candles lit
 I like my raps extra prolific
 Since freestyling on lunch tables and park benches
 And I won’t mention my 10,000 hours in training
 While juggling, gang-banging, my balancing was tremendous
 And now we look at the competition as quick submission
 They tappin’ out before we even get a chance to miss ‘em
 What this about, is it money or skill?
 Maybe it’s both and I got large amounts of it, it’s real
 You see my oath is very unbreakable, my style is never mistakable
 I can see y’all incapable
 To be the God emcees, you know me well
 Ridiculous, venomous, hate in my heart, the sinister
 Run for cover, my lineage prove itself
 I’m rollin’ deep in that paper like two Adeles
 Before scholars, I flowed tighter than virgin lips
 We here to shake the game up and you're flying through turbulence
 Everything is high stakes nowadays, that’s how it played nowadays
 It’s like an 8-ball to the face nowadays
 I'm laced nowadays, my gun is off the waist nowadays
 It’s seven figures and retainer for the case nowadays, I'm talking
 Higher power, every other hour since Eddie Bauer
 Since stash boxes and lead showers, breaking the padlock
 And the dead coward dying a thousand deaths, entire lion
 Surround itself with bears, watch it nigga, you share a profit, ah!
 This is what they want, I’m the one
 This is vintage from 1980 somethin'
 I’m the son of the pioneer that got you near the sun
 Play with him, bitch you better off voting for Donald Trump
 I’m yelling Mr. Kanye West for president
 He probably let me get some head inside the residence
 I’m in the White House going all out
 Bumping College Dropout, God bless Americans
 Nothing more influential than rap music
 I merge jazz fusion with the trap music
 I mix black soul with some rock and roll
 They never box me in, I’m David Blaine-ing all you hoes
 Oh yea, let’s go there, my DNA is DMT, I’m so rare
 My Juvenile was wilder than the Nolia
 A locomotive couldn’t track me down in my career
 Runnin’ this shit with four pair, son of my bitch, I might demolish
 A bitch right in front ya, chico, what have you done here?
 D-Bo, all of it one year, Mississippi to California
 It gets annoying, niggas wanna deplore him
 And bitches wanna adore him, but industry shit ain’t for him
 Probably thinking it’s for him, only one me
 Swallowed the key and kicking the door in, never leasing my foreign
 Mr. Valevictorian studied the game before them
 Listen to you with boredom, baby rappers, abort them
 To the grave I deport them, corporations extort them
 I’m snapping off my endorphins, I alien mighty morphin’
 My radiance rather gorgeous, hundred bill to the doorman
 Hundred mil' in my fortune, they call me back in the morning
 You're racing against the tortoise, pace myself it’s important
 Lace myself with the wisdom my playerism enormous
 So pay the man for performance, saucy all of my garments
 Jimi Kendrix performing, this fucking studio haunted (Ah!)
 I tell a bitch don’t sweat me (Don't sweat me)
 I kill this whole fuckin’ beat if Cole let me (Please Cole)
 Ib should’ve never sent the instrumental
 Every time I start writing I get sentimental
 This shit is just not fair
 But why the fuck should I care?
 The story of your life here
 Two young stars was born and y’all gon’ die here
 Oh Lord, gotta be the yams
 Billboard list need 2Pac, damn
 But number 9 makes sure he lives on, yeah
 Hoochie, coochie, pussies in a trance
 Every day a celebration, but even the valley peaking me
 Is not validation, nigga this TDE
 And my doggies be salivating, salaries, better ratings
 And casualties all around me, don’t make me do demonstrations
 Whoa
 Murder my allegations and burning my finger traces
 Adjourning my power patience and earning royalty payments
 I’m sorry y’all not relating, this party is reservated
 I kill this whole muthafucking beat if J. Cole say it
 My nigga Ib chopped the instrumental, I gotta slay it
 I gotta lay it, gotta show you fuckers I’m not to play with
 The ruckus had been my favorite, King Kunta the fuckin’ greatest
 Whoa
 Burnin’ my leather-

 All I have is me in the land of do or die
 A freeway, a gas pedal, and a peace of mind
 Now, that's the ultimate high
 To the cloud I go, cloud I go
 One time, baby tell me ya need me
 Cloud I go, cloud I go
 Two time, baby tell me ya love me
 Cause I've been drinking too much, thinking too much
 We ain't been keeping in touch
 Fell into lust, where is the love?
 My independency got tendencies of lack of trust
 I look at the street corners as my new woman
 Seductive as she want to be, hands all on my garments
 And luckily, being in denial ain't the case
 Cause I know she's unfaithful
 Instead I'm grabbing her waist
 And every part of her is tasteful
 I know you're feelings hating
 In fact, you think I'm ungrateful.. I know
 Selfish as I wanna be and every time you under me
 I get the vibe you might need some time to grow
 When the sun fall out the sky
 All I have is me in the land of do or die
 A freeway, a gas pedal, and a peace of mind
 Now, that's the ultimate high
 To the cloud I go, cloud I go
 One time, baby tell me ya need me
 Cloud I go, cloud I go
 Two time, baby tell me ya love me
 Cause I been drinking too much, thinking too much
 We ain't been keeping in touch
 And every time that I think of your touch
 Adrenaline pump, give me that rush
 I'm going like a thief inside the wind
 Lord forgive me for my sins
 I know she want me more, but I fiend for benjamins
 She said I found the root of all evil
 And lost a friend
 Lost in the world of a young boy from Compton
 That never knew love because love was never promised
 I know.. selfish as I wanna be
 And every time I'm under you, me too
 Need time to grow
 When the sun fall out the sky
 All I have is me in the land of do or die
 A freeway, a gas pedal, and a peace of mind
 Now, that's the ultimate high

 No Promethazine I’m a king, no leaning
 I got a better way to fight them demons
 Fuck do you know ‘bout my pain?
 If I quote it nigga, I wrote it nigga
 Six head shots, I’ll erode a nigga
 Pop another clip and I'm reloaded nigga
 Ain’t no way around it, I’m the coldest nigga
 Do a nigga dirty life's a coal, my nigga
 Get you cleaned up then I fold you nigga
 Shout out to the haters who promote a nigga
 Flow hot, whip cold, I’m bipolar nigga
 But I don’t like to talk about a Rover nigga
 Keep this shit a hundred, I just sold it nigga
 Tired of police looking at me like I stole it nigga
 Probably just gonna cop a lil Corolla nigga
 Don’t need a rollie on to know I’m getting older nigga
 Dreamville going way up like a floater nigga
 Couple hands out like I owe them niggas
 Where was you when the Civic was getting towed my nigga?
 No snakes in the grass cause I mowed it nigga
 Fuck do you know ‘bout my pain?
 (Right there let me get that there
 Talk about it)
 Fuck do you know ‘bout my dreams?
 (Talk about it)

 If I take a ride, fuck around get lost
 Cole world you should stay off this dick
 I sold out the Garden, I should play for the Knicks
 Took a couple minutes and I sold out Staples
 A nigga getting cream like an old ass Laker
 But I ain’t coming to talk about all that paper
 That’s what they talk about when they ain’t got shit to say
 Can’t understand why niggas never got shit to do
 You know the saying, same shit nigga, different day
 I never felt that, no way
 Cause on the same day a nigga doing different shit
 Spit different flows hit different chicks
 Let my Brixton hoes feed me fish and chips
 Why I do a lot of shows? I’m the shit, that’s it
 Got suicidal doors, I just slit my wrists
 Never stingy with the hoes word to Cliff and Chris
 So if I fuck six bitches I got six assists nigga
 The flow sick as shit, catch ebola if you bit this shit
 I never take, I invent the shit then flip the shit
 Then lick the shit, and bit the shit back twice, I’m that nice, woo
 What’s the plan?
 Cole keeps snapping like a Mustard jam
 Got a middle finger for Uncle Sam
 I done paid so much taxes I can fund Japan
 But instead they make a young nigga fund the man
 Same man that keep a young nigga under, damn
 I just cocked back nigga and my gun don’t jam
 On a scale from one to ten I’m a hundred grand
 It's Cole fuckin’ world nigga
 Dreamville in this motherfucker, Top Dawg in this motherfucker

6 Foot - 7 Foot,Two,,7,4:11,,Mixtape (Black Hippy),2,22 Apr 20,14,"Said I'm a fuckin' monster
 A massive attack, I haunt ya'
 I mastered the rap then fucked up the monitors
 Mastered that after that I went for thermometers
 Popped 'em all, then popped in the jaw of Tracy Veronica
 Holla back they promised us
 No pajamas insomnia
 Will attack, I attack like piranha does
 Hit your block like a comet (Blah!)
 And you all know what time it is
 2012, mark your calendars calisthenics and silencers exercisin' that trigger strap
 Rock with us, Metallica, competition no talented
 I'm in a jungle what's wild enough
 Just might stumble upon a pack of lions
 No lyin' my soldiers dyin' this is Iraq
 Alliances lining with stars and bars of a prison rep
 My science applyin' pressure, her stretcher is needed, pay the proceeds
 Or your livin' debt y'all soft as a giga-pet
 You niggas can't see me unless you watchin' the TV or ultra huggin' my silhouette
 My flow got the ceiling wet, I spit 'til I feel my breath
 Who sinkin' my fuckin' chest? She fuckin' the fuckin' best
 Mean my dick is the dick of death, mean I'm killin that pussy
 Like Spike whenever that Jerry slept
 Yeah, Dre
 Me and Andre the Giant, 6'7 and climbin'
 Whether you storm to your climate
 Whether your beat makin' or rhyming
 Bumpin some Phyllis Hyman
 Hand full of diamonds like Jay fans
 On a island with Ray Bans
 Glasses palmin' asses that probably came wit a great tan (laughs)
 I be the motherfuckin' mecca of these hub city spectrum
 Where they at I will dissect them like a fucking frog rectum
 Why you wreckin' with irreputable my worst flow incredible
 They probably call the federal after I slaughter several
 Etcetera etcetera Bentley passin up Celicas
 They tellin' us about shit, HiiiPoWeR in your mouth, bitch
 And Top Dawg can vouch bitch
 Nigga what you 'bout, about face with army outfits
 The generals here
 That mean the hustlers and the criminals here
 Penitence reachin' pinnacles of life and despair and me I solemnly swear to handle mine like a Taliban and die for it
 Only difference is I ain't never askin' Allah for it
 Only difference is I be spazzin' and still a proud poet
 Put me in a category
 I don't know what's a sadder story
 Guts and glory
 Your pain bore me you ain't really lived it
 I take you to a block where they Crippin
 Or Piru that 5'2 gun bigger than the torso of Pippen
 Bitch I been doin' before you niggas ruined it
 Show me somethin' different
 You either kissin' dick or givin' me distance
 You live in a district of dimebags and dummies I know your statistics
 Who your boss, he more like my assistant
 Get lost have a egg and a biscuit
 Break fast when we aimin' them biscuits
 Pay cash when your chain come up missin'
 Q...Q
 Double up, shit, what the fuck?
 Get me some my promo poppin'
 Setbacks droppin'
 Soon they watchin'
 I just lock and load explode
 Target flowed I'm somewhere blowed
 Marriotts and Swisher Sweets
 LA nigga prolly east
 Cheerin' for the ragin' beats
 X O henny scrape the keif
 Bangin C I'm bangin' B
 Put them niggas next to me
 Stop and focus get the lead
 I'm here now let the hardest speak
 Ya all them dudes got ovaries, period
 Run on sentence still I'm ventin'
 Air conditionin' coolest breeze
 Ill diseases
 Grip my penis, shoot my semen
 Still I'm comin', miles a runnin'
 I was learnin' getting knowledge
 Head is throbbin', she's a goblin
 We be mobbin' over bitches
 Stick and miss and she the business
 Get a witness pussy frenchin
 Yes, a mission
 Poppin' off like on a mission
 Proposition, gettin' money
 Drop a nigga, rush a nigga
 Stomp a nigga, crush a nigga
 Dust a nigga, copperhead gon' thrust a nigga
 Heatin' up the winnnin nigga
 Somethin' to remember nigga
 Hella sick, I got a spit
 Curse with a verse like God told me to kill the shit
 Load the clip Heckler & Koch
 The hoover king
 Bada bing by the ding a ling
 Natural hoover
 Fing ring with a vision clearin' it with Visine
 Asian from Beijing
 Money make her cum, she C.R.E.A.M.

Word Harder,Two,,11,2:42,,Mixtape (Black Hippy),2,22 Apr 20,14,"Yeah, it's been a minute
 I'm give it to you though
 Yeah, Rock been doing this shit, east side up
 Hearts get to skipping a beat when we ride up
 9-double-0-5-9 that's the zip, dog
 Don't make me put 3 in your back like Chris Paul
 We just go straight to the facts, been the shit dog
 Even if the globe on my back down in the pitfall
 When Top Dawg drop this shit, haters they pissed off
 They tell me Rock the street is yours, go and get yours
 Riding with that big ass yopper with a bad ass bopper
 Swerving lane to lane pass that vodka
 All we see is a bunch of dickriders
 Fake ass hoes with silicones in they dreez-awers
 Cheesy ass chain wearing niggas claim they be hard
 We don't even believe y'all
 What's brackin' nigga? Whats crackin' nigga?
 Never walked the yard but I ran with killers
 And if you got a guilty conscious what's happenin' nigga
 You don't wanna meet your heroes
 You don't wanna meet your heroes
 They're known to sink your shit like torpedoes
 They say a nigga broke and aggressive
 If I'm broke and aggressive
 That means I hit your section, impressing to bring the depression
 I'm watching you like VEVO nigga
 I'm peeping through that keyhole nigga
 So my advice you better change your locks
 Cause when I kick doors down, nigga, things'll pop
 I see you getting racks and I see you getting 'Lacs
 You see me and my niggas gettin' strapped
 Yeah, the homie, he just got up out the max
 It's time to pay just what you owe, so you know you gettin' taxed
 I'm rolling up phillies nigga
 Thinking about billies nigga
 Check come through, yeah I'm popping the wheelie nigga
 Straight to the dealership
 No flocking no stealing shit
 Straight cash money, on my Bryan B. Williams shit
 Better yet this is a robbery, pushing up on your property
 Kicking off of monopolies, been here sounding so properly
 It ain't no stopping me, yeah I'm fulfilling prophecy
 Robberies yeah they obsolete, better keep all your eyes on me
 Watch me closely, move ghostly, hit them hard like cold cheese
 Don't sleep, and after that I'll give you something to smoke
 That A1 Peruvian, ain't no cut on this dope
 Rock
 That's it, seven to midnight every night
 This the lift off
 Let's get it",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,https://i1.sndcdn.com/artworks-sZ3YH02HkgOs-0-original.jpg,,,,https://soundcloud.com/blackhippyofficial/sets/two,,,,,,,162,2.7,0.05,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1,,,,,,,1,,,,,,,,,,,,,1,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Blessed My,Two,,12,5:08,,Mixtape (Black Hippy),2,22 Apr 20,14,"What is life for a nigga like me?
 Living out his backpack every night
 Needed a new place to sleep
 But this is now, nigga
 One's for the money, two for the bitches
 Three to get ready cause I feel I finally did it
 Four's for the jealous rapper mad because he finished
 Turn that mothafucka to a critic
 Man, I got so much shit up on my plate, dog
 I was hanging on them corners late
 Pockets wasn't straight, bitch
 I ain't gon' make it at this rate, dog, know what I'm saying?
 Nigga praying up to God just hoping that he hear a nigga
 I know the world got more problems and it's much bigger
 But I figured, I'd get some shit up off my chest
 To all my niggas I would die for, load my pistol up, go out and war for
 To all my niggas that'll never make it out the streets
 Fuck it, keep goin' hard, don't let 'em see you weak
 To all my niggas first time stepping in the pen
 Read a book and exercise, keep your spirit in
 To all my niggas that's gon' fuck around and die today
 Take our hats off, bow our heads and let us pray, just wanna say
 Stay blessed my nigga, blessed my nigga
 Really think about it, could be worse my nigga
 Don't stress my nigga, yes, my nigga
 We all blessed my nigga
 Stay blessed my nigga, blessed my nigga
 Really think about it, could be worse my nigga
 Don't stress my nigga, yes, my nigga
 We all blessed my nigga, ah
 Now how the fuck I'm 'posed to say this?
 You see my nigga just lost his son
 While I'm here hugging on my daughter, I grip her harder
 Kiss her on the head as I cry for a bit
 Thinking of some bullshit to tell him
 Like ""It'll be okay, you'll be straight, it'll be aight""
 Well, fuck that shit
 Whatever you need, yo, I got it!
 Whether it's money or some weed or putting in work
 Fuck it, then I'm riding
 You know what's up, but now a nigga couldn't stick around
 Told myself that after y'all moved
 That I'd be a fuckin' fool, to be living by the street rules
 ""Fuck police"" tattoos, that happens when you ditch school
 But anyway, keep the faith
 Stay strong, bruh, remain solid, bruh
 Keep playing ball, cuz
 It's the only way up out it, bruh, a nigga proud of ya
 Tell Floyd to enjoy his newborn seed
 I'll have whatever he needs, we the last of a dying breed
 Live life, smoke trees
 See how far we've come but most, I'm sorry for your son
 Stay blessed my nigga, blessed my nigga
 Really think about it, could be worse my nigga
 Don't stress my nigga, yes, my nigga
 We all blessed my nigga
 Stay blessed my nigga, blessed my nigga
 Really think about it, could be worse my nigga
 Don't stress my nigga, yes, my nigga
 We all blessed my nigga, ah
 And you ain't gotta shed no tear
 I'll be everywhere but I'ma always be right here
 I ain't forgot those years
 I'll be everywhere but I'ma always be right here
 Living in a premature place, wait
 Never grow to see the pearly gates, break
 Every time a bullet detonate, dates
 Of obituary carry crates
 Of a scary picture with a family member that relate to ya
 In December you was finna pin another case
 On your record in a stolen Expedition, play it safe
 As the record spinning, you was hearing angels entertain
 Every pun intended, that was wicked, coming from your brain
 Recognize you listened and you didn't hit the block again
 That's because the minute after you had knew you would be slain
 Open up another chapter in the book and read 'gain
 Story of a gun-clapper really tryna make a change
 Everybody ain't blessed, my nigga
 Yes, my nigga, you're blessed, take advantage, do your best, my nigga
 Don't stress, you was granted everything inside this planet
 Anything you imagine, you possess, my nigga
 You reject these niggas that neglect your respect
 For the progress of a baby step, my nigga
 Step-step my nigga, one, two, skip-skip
 Back-back, look both ways, pull it off the hip
 Blast at anybody say that you can't flip
 This crack into rap music every other zip is a track
 Get used to it, get it off quick
 Come back, give back to the city you've built
 That's that, don't trip, see money, fuck niggas, dog
 It ain't nothing but a bunch of fuck niggas, dog
 In a minute everybody gon' be winning
 Put a little faith in it then recognize that we all
 Blessed my nigga, blessed my nigga
 Really think about it, could be worse my nigga
 Don't stress my nigga, yes, my nigga
 We all blessed my nigga, ah",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,https://i1.sndcdn.com/artworks-sZ3YH02HkgOs-0-original.jpg,,,,https://soundcloud.com/blackhippyofficial/sets/two,,,,,,,308,5.13,0.09,,Yes,15,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1,,,,,,,,,,,,,,3,,,,,1,,,,,,,,,1,1,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Diary of a Broke Nigga,Two,,13,3:37,,Mixtape (Black Hippy),2,22 Apr 20,14,"Look inside the eyes of a broke nigga
 See the stress on his face
 Look at his heart, ain't no love in the place
 What's on his mind? - murder, money and mayhem
 If he don't see a dollar somebody visiting Satan
 He grabbed his gat from under the mattress, he cocked it back
 Then grabbed his gloves and a mask, then threw on his hat
 Looked in the mirror and said, ""times is hard""
 So hard that he got gray hair on his balls - pause
 In the ghetto, you destined to fall
 That's why it's a must that we ball
 That's why he on the corner lurkin', waitin' for a mothafucka to slip
 Soon as he see the chance, he takin' a risk
 What should you do, when this nigga snatch you out of your whip
 Empty out your pockets then snatch what's on your neck and your wrist, nothing!
 'Cause when the gat in ya mouth, so speechless
 Any false move and ya brains on the cement
 It gets gutter, when niggas starvin'
 Niggas will run inside ya house, kill you on target--heartless
 This is way beyond a cold thriller
 This the diary of a broke nigga
 Pump pump
 Everybody lay down on the ground
 Give me whatever you got right now
 Pump pump
 Everybody lay down on the floor
 Give me whatever you got plus more
 When times is hard and I'm prayin' for change
 My funds is low when I need some change
 Wop wop
 Make sure you hide your goods when I come mista
 You dealin' with the diary of a broke nigga
 It's been a whole month he still ain't see no paper
 Nigga losin' weight every time that he wake up
 Plus, he tired of askin' niggas for favors
 Cuz when they got mad they throw it back in his face
 That's foul, flagrant this nigga been slavin'
 In the spot all week still ain't see no paper, that's fucked up
 They say don't bite the hand that feeds you but if that hand don't feed you where would that leave you?
 Now that the stress come
 Can't turn back the hands of time
 Got him thinkin' back on what he should've done
 First thing on his mind now get a gun
 Shit you gotta eat, and you got a son
 And a daughter, now that's two mouths to feed
 And that money seems far like miles to reach
 But it's right there
 But his brain clouded
 Life on the wrong road can't reroute it
 Caught the nigga, and showed him what that heater do
 If you don't feed your wolves your wolves eat you
 This is way beyond a cold thriller
 This the diary of a broke nigga
 Pump pump
 Everybody lay down on the ground
 Give me whatever you got right now
 Pump pump
 Everybody lay down on the floor
 Give me whatever you got plus more
 When times is hard and I'm prayin' for change
 My funds is low when I need some change
 Wop wop
 Make sure you hide your goods when I come mista

My People,Two,,14,4:03,,Mixtape (Black Hippy),2,22 Apr 20,14,"My people don't love me
 Why we hate each other?
 Why we kill our brothers, why we hurt our mothers?
 My people don't love me
 We can love one another
 We should stick together because we're all we got
 My people don't love me
 Why we ride on another, need to love one another
 We all we got
 My people don't love me
 I said we all we got, I swear to God dog we all we got
 My people don't love me
 This whole world's spillin' senseless killing
 Universe beyond evil, one topic to serve
 Be my black people, we be missing the point like Shaq's freethrow
 Sean Taylor, life gone because of haters
 A nigga he known tried home invasion, went wrong
 Bullet penetrated his leg, femur bone
 Days later, wake arrangements, flowers to be catered
 That was so impatient, take him from the next man
 Cause he ain't got the will to hustle like he can
 Niggas would rather steal than think of a righteous plan
 To get residuals, kill for dividends
 This life is critical, we living in a time where
 Nine-year olds tote 9s
 Turn ten, it's MAC 10s and coke lines
 I wonder why successful black man gotta die from a black man
 My people don't love me
 Why everywhere I go I got to accumulate some hate?
 My people don't love me
 Genocide all we know shit, we basically in the KKK
 OK-K-K, I'm trying to make my cake
 But every time I turn around you take it from me
 Black people don't love me
 Hate each other we do each other wrong
 That's why today, black people let's love we
 Can't be a positive black role model
 Leading the future with no haters to follow
 Now that's fucked up, if I ever wanna see
 Success, I gotta see death? Be famous for what?
 He aiming for higher learning, you aiming to shoot him down
 He flying straight, you wanna u-turn him
 You burn your brother's bridges
 His accomplishments making way for your children
 Still you don't compliment, inconsiderate black pride
 No never been, never win, gotta lose
 That's the slope that's for the black heritage
 We play the fool better than comedians
 Disobediant dude no respect, ethics
 I refuse to be a statistic
 But changing my community don't seem realistic
 Show me an African American doing right
 I'll show you one that will kill his ass tonight
 My people don't love me
 Why everywhere I go I got to accumulate some hate?
 My people don't love me
 Genocide all we know shit, we basically in the KKK
 OK-K-K, I'm trying to make my cake
 But every time I turn around you take it from me
 Black people don't love me
 Hate each other we do each other wrong
 That's why today, black people let's love we
 We stuck together back in slavery days
 Martin and Malcolm them dudes paved the way
 The bullshit we doing, I know they're turning over in their graves
 The shit need to stop today
 Yeah the die for the cause, some like Jesus for us
 To become better people, think about it
 We used to run from the KKK
 But now we running from our brothers that be holding them k's
 Man, never thought there'd be days like this
 Can't trust your homies that you're hanging with
 Damn shame, why you kill a nigga over a chain
 When you could get up on your hustle and get the same thing
 United we stand tall, divided we all fall
 Let's leave this bullshit behind y'all
 On the real, the envy and the hate need to stop
 Black people we all we got
 My people don't love me
 Why everywhere I go I got to accumulate some hate?
 My people don't love me
 Genocide all we know shit, we basically in the KKK
 OK-K-K, I'm trying to make my cake
 But every time I turn around you take it from me
 Black people don't love me
 Hate each other we do each other wrong
 That's why today, black people let's love we
 Y'all better wake up and smell the coffee
 We all we got man
 It's black on black killing each other man it needs to stop
 Real talk
 Black people need to smarten up
 We all we got",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,https://i1.sndcdn.com/artworks-sZ3YH02HkgOs-0-original.jpg,,,,https://soundcloud.com/blackhippyofficial/sets/two,,,,,,,243,4.05,0.07,,Yes,11,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1,,,,1,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,3,,,,,,,,1,1,,1,,,,,1,,6,,19,,,,,,,,,,1,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1,,,,
